A combination of insufficient time to complete tasks, clinical documentation burden, and electronic inbox overload comprises the definition of documentation-related burnout. Burnout mitigation strategies related to clinical documentation include use of targeted EHR training for documentation, use of medical scribes, and institutional documentation redesign. Mitigation strategies related to electronic inbox overload include assigning designated administrative time for inbox management, tailoring of message content to decrease length, and a team-based approach to clinical workflows. Best practices for improving the efficiency of clinical documentation in the EHR include use of automation tools (eg, macros, templates), physician note optimization, and use of team-based documentation. Clinical documentation aids such as medical scribes, speech recognition software, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based software are popular and often considered a necessary resource in health care. For most practices, decisions regarding which aid to use will likely be determined by cost. Speech recognition software is the lowest cost option. AI-based software and medical scribes are more costly.","2-s2.0-85185240364"

This report analyzes the extent to which an artificial intelligence (AI) agent's performance on these sample items can generalize to performance on an actual USMLE examination and an illustration is given using ChatGPT. Method As with earlier investigations, analyses were based on publicly available USMLE sample items. Each item was submitted to ChatGPT (version 3.5) 3 times to evaluate stability. Responses were scored following rules that match operational practice, and a preliminary analysis explored the characteristics of items that ChatGPT answered correctly. The study was conducted between February and March 2023. Results For the full sample of items, ChatGPT scored above 60% correct except for one replication for Step 3. Response success varied across replications for 76 items (20%). There was a modest correspondence with item difficulty wherein ChatGPT was more likely to respond correctly to items found easier by examinees. ChatGPT performed significantly worse (P <.001) on items relating to practice-based learning. Conclusions Achieving 60% accuracy is an approximate indicator of meeting the passing standard, requiring statistical adjustments for comparison. Hence, this assessment can only suggest consistency with the passing standards for Steps 1 and 2 Clinical Knowledge, with further limitations in extrapolating this inference to Step 3. These limitations are due to variances in item difficulty and exclusion of the simulation component of Step 3 from the evaluation - limitations that would apply to any AI system evaluated on the Step 3 sample items. It is crucial to note that responses from large language models exhibit notable variations when faced with repeated inquiries, underscoring the need for expert validation to ensure their utility as a learning tool.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","2-s2.0-85184144869"

Methods: This scoping review followed the PRISMA, PRISMA-ScR guidelines, and five stage methodological framework for scoping reviews. Studies of patients undergoing primary or revision joint arthroplasty surgery that utilised AI-based 3D templating for surgical planning were included. Outcome measures included dataset and model development characteristics, AI performance metrics, and time performance. After AI-based 3D planning, the accuracy of component size and placement estimation and postoperative outcome data were collected. Results: Nine studies satisfied inclusion criteria including a focus on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–based AI templating for use in hip or knee arthroplasty. AI-based 3D templating systems reduced surgical planning time and improved implant size/position and imaging feature estimation compared to conventional radiographic templating. Several components of data processing and model development and testing were insufficiently covered in the studies included in this scoping review. Conclusions: AI-based 3D templating systems have the potential to improve preoperative planning for joint arthroplasty surgery. This technology offers more accurate and personalized preoperative planning, which has potential to improve functional outcomes for patients. However, deficiencies in several key areas, including data handling, model development, and testing, can potentially hinder the reproducibility and reliability of the methods proposed. As such, further research is needed to definitively evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of these systems. © 2024, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to SICOT aisbl.","2-s2.0-85182492707"

While the prevailing view is that these technologies generally have a positive effect on student learning, their impact on students’ agency and ability to self-regulate their learning is under-explored. Do students learn from the regular, detailed and personalised feedback provided by AI systems, and will they continue to exhibit similar behaviour in the absence of assistance? Or do they instead continue to rely on AI assistance without learning from it? To contribute to filling this research gap, we conducted a randomised controlled experiment that explored the impact of AI assistance on student agency in the context of peer feedback. With 1625 students across 10 courses, an experiment was conducted using peer review. During the initial four-week period, students were guided by AI features that utilised techniques such as rule-based suggestion detection, semantic similarity, and comparison with previous comments made by the reviewer to enhance their submissions if the feedback provided was deemed insufficiently detailed or general in nature. Over the following four weeks, students were divided into four different groups: control (AI) received prompts, (NR) received no prompts, (SR) received self-monitoring checklists in place of AI prompts, and (SAI) had access to both AI prompts and self-monitoring checklists. Results of the experiment suggest that students tended to rely on rather than learn from AI assistance. If AI assistance was removed, self-regulated strategies could help fill the gap but were not as effective as AI assistance. Results also showed that hybrid human-AI approaches that complement AI assistance with self-regulated strategies (SAI) were not more effective than AI assistance on its own. We conclude by discussing the broader benefits, challenges and implications of relying on AI assistance in relation to student agency in a world where we learn, live and work with AI. © 2023 The Author(s)","2-s2.0-85180370849"

These tools can perform actions such as choosing the ‘safest’ medication, choosing between competing medications, promoting de-prescribing or even predicting non-adherence. These tools can exist in a variety of formats; for example, they may be directly integrated into electronic medical records or they may exist in a stand-alone website accessible by a web browser. One potential impact of these tools is that they could manipulate our understanding of the benefit-risk of medicines in the real world. Currently, the benefit risk of approved medications is assessed according to carefully planned agreements covering spontaneous reporting systems and planned surveillance studies. But AI-based tools may limit or even block prescription to high-risk patients or prevent off-label use. The uptake and temporal availability of these tools may be uneven across healthcare systems and geographies, creating artefacts in data that are difficult to account for. It is also hard to estimate the ‘true impact’ that a tool had on a prescribing decision. International borders may also be highly porous to these tools, especially in cases where tools are available over the web. These tools already exist, and their use is likely to increase in the coming years.

Existing challenges related to patch panel assembly line task distribution, process content, and tooling layout are scrutinised against production process standards for operational measurements. To achieve improvement, Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models are employed in hidden layers, supplemented by deep feed-forward (DFF) layers for output, in adherence to engineering design principles. The bottleneck station's load rate is successfully reduced to below 80%, contributing to an overall balance rate increase from 73% to 88%.

While there has been significant progress in developing explainability methods for AI, such advancements do not consider black-box optimization algorithms. In this paper, we present RX-BO (Rule based Explanations for Bayesian Optimization), a novel framework that brings explainability to black-box Bayesian optimization with a Gaussian process (GP) backbone. Leveraging the GP model’s approximation and uncertainty estimation capabilities, RX-BO extracts distribution-aware rules through a post-hoc rule based explainability method. These rules shed light on different regions of the posterior distribution, enabling transparent and trustworthy decision making. The framework incorporates a pairwise Mahalanobis distance-based hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm with Ward criterion for generating rule proposals. It also employs traditional metrics such as support, coverage, and confidence for selecting high-quality explanations. We evaluate RX-BO on an example optimization problem and six hyperparameter optimization tasks involving three machine learning models (classification and regression) across two datasets. The results demonstrate that RX-BO improves rule confidence and rule granularity control compared to decision trees and Rule based XAI frameworks. Furthermore, RX-BO introduces a novel approach by identifying interesting areas in the search space based on likelihood. This measure allows to rank explanations on how interesting they would be for an end user.

Conventional ordinary Portland cement (OPC) is not thermodynamically compatible with the carbon dioxide (CO2) present in CO2 storage media. When OPC cement sheaths interact with aqueous CO2, they undergo degradation, producing calcium bicarbonate. This bicarbonate readily dissolves in the formation aquifer and can create leakage pathways, compromising the integrity of the wellbores. This study comprehensively reviews the state-of-the-art techniques for evaluating cement sheath integrity, providing a comprehensive compendium of available methods in a single article. The paper’s objective is to support the deployment of successful CCS projects, facilitate the remediation of affected wellbores in CO2 storage systems, and offer guidelines for evaluating improved cement slurry designs and formulations. Additionally, the study identifies the factors that influence cement sheath integrity when exposed to aqueous CO2, including in-situ temperature and pressure, reservoir fluid characteristics, cement slurry formulations, and wellbore operations. Furthermore, various modes of mechanical failure in cement sheaths are identified, such as radial cracking, plastic deformation, inner and outer debonding, and channeling. Understanding these failure mechanisms is crucial for designing robust cementing strategies in CCS applications. Evaluation techniques for assessing the integrity of cement sheaths exposed to aqueous CO2 encompass a range of approaches. These include direct experimentation with samples that mimic the in -situ conditions of storage sites, well logging for monitoring leakages, analytical, numerical, and statistical modeling, and risk assessments. Direct experimentation plays a vital role in understanding the carbonation kinetics and changes in cement sheaths' mechanical and transport properties. Techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, back-scattered electron image detectors, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, mercury intrusion porosimetry, optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity imaging, electron probe microanalyzers, inductivity-coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, X-ray computed microtomography, Raman spectroscopy, direct image correlation, and particle velocimetry are utilized for direct experimentation. Analytical and numerical modeling approaches include reactive transport modeling, multi-scale modeling, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and artificial intelligence (AI)-based modeling. In field operations, the integrity of the cement sheaths can be evaluated using cement bond evaluation tools, pressure transient test tools, cement coring tools, or sustained casing pressure analysis. These techniques collectively enable a comprehensive assessment of the integrity of cement sheath exposed to aqueous CO2, aiding in optimizing and monitoring carbon storage systems. Every CO2 storage medium is unique. Optimal assessment of the cement sheaths' integrity of its wellbore systems, when exposed to aqueous CO2, would require a different combination of suitable evaluation techniques. Future studies should focus on developing standardized guidelines that combine laboratory testing, field-scale testing, and numerical modeling to predict the evolution of cement sheath integrity when exposed to aqueous CO2.

Specifically, ChatGPT, a language processing model developed by OpenAI, represents a significant advancement in this field. By presenting child health-related information in an understandable and interactive manner, ChatGPT can potentially enhance the health consciousness of children and their families. Its capacity to facilitate access to health services for children and families in rural areas has been emphasized in various studies. Moreover, ChatGPT’s ability to provide real-time feedback to students promotes more effective learning and encourages personalized education. However, the use of ChatGPT in child health education also brings with it certain limitations and ethical concerns. Risks such as the propagation of inaccurate or misleading information, inequalities in access to technology, and issues related to privacy and data security need to be addressed carefully. To overcome these ethical and technical limitations, it is necessary to develop more effective data management strategies and carefully considered ethical guidelines. In addition, collaboration between policymakers and educators is crucial in addressing inequalities in access to technology. © 2023 SHAPE America.","2-s2.0-85179690611"

This research area has attracted the attention of both teachers and students of Theory, Analysis and Composition, looking for support tools for the learning process. The main problem is that the systems designed and developed up to now harmonize a melody written by a user without considering the didactic and therefore cognitive aspects at the basis of a “significant learning”: given a melody, the system returns a harmonization finished without any user input. This paper describes a self-learning algorithm capable of harmonizing a musical melody, with the aim of supporting the student during the study of Theory, Analysis and Composition. The algorithm, on the basis of the ascending and descending movement of the sounds of the melody (soprano), proposes the sounds for the bass line: the Viterbi algorithm was applied to evaluate the probability of the best match between the melody sounds and the provided Markov chains, to reach the “optimal” state sequences. Subsequently, the algorithm allows the user to complete the chords for each sound of the bass line (tenor and alto), or to create the complete chords. Examples of musical fragments harmonized in this way demonstrate that the algorithm is able to respect the concatenation rules of the tonal functions which characterize classical tonal music. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85182518188"

By utilising machine learning and deep learning approaches, AI-enabled systems may accomplish tasks as well as improve their own performance. These capabilities are useful in the often-remote settings of outer space and will grow in value as automated space operations become more widespread. As AI extends throughout the space domain, automated algorithms will take on many of the roles that have historically been handled by humans. Artificial intelligence is progressing from theory to implementation in the space environment by exposing new satellites and orbital autonomous vehicles to new data. Even though all initial computational parameters are provided, such systems' outputs can be very unpredictable, putting people, property, and the environment at risk. This paper investigates the application of United Nations space treaties, selected regional AI regulations, and various 'soft-law' instruments and industry initiatives focusing on responsible AI system development to space-based AI systems. Following that, reforms are proposed to clarify the practical relationship between AI systems and the international legal regime that governs space, as well as a 'bottom-up' regulatory approach to better facilitate the future development of regulation governing the use of AI by the global space sector. While this work does not purport to provide a conclusive resolution to these multifaceted matters, its objective is to underscore significant obstacles that arise at the convergence of space law and AI, serving as a preliminary foundation for subsequent discussions on this issue. © 2024 The Authors","2-s2.0-85185494434"

Therefore, the Dutch Association of Insurers supported the industry by publishing an ethical framework. However, the framework is a set of high-level requirements, and the question is how these requirements are translated into local practices. Our research question is how ethical requirements are applied by insurance companies when using AI systems to detect fraud in insurance claims. To answer this question, we conducted interviews with representatives of four different organizations. The study demonstrates the awareness amongst interviewees that AI needs to be applied in a responsible way. The ethical framework provides a good starting point for insurers to develop their own practical ethical guidelines. Empirical evidence confirms that accountability, safety, transparency, non-discrimination, and human agency are priorities in the process of AI implementation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic literature search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, LILACS and Embase databases for retrospective, prospective and cross-sectional studies published until January 2023, using the following keywords: artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), artificial neural networks (ANN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), radiology, detection, diagnosis and dental caries (DC). The quality assessment was performed using the guidelines of QUADAS-2. RESULTS: Twenty articles that met the selection criteria were evaluated. Five studies were performed on periapical radiographs, nine on bitewings, and six on orthopantomography. The number of imaging examinations included ranged from 15 to 2900. Four studies investigated ANN models, fifteen CNN models, and two DCNN models. Twelve were retrospective studies, six cross-sectional and two prospective. The following diagnostic performance was achieved in detecting CL: sensitivity from 0.44 to 0.86, specificity from 0.85 to 0.98, precision from 0.50 to 0.94, PPV (Positive Predictive Value) 0.86, NPV (Negative Predictive Value) 0.95, accuracy from 0.73 to 0.98, area under the curve (AUC) from 0.84 to 0.98, intersection over union of 0.3-0.4 and 0.78, Dice coefficient 0.66 and 0.88, F1-score from 0.64 to 0.92. According to the QUADAS-2 evaluation, most studies exhibited a low risk of bias. CONCLUSION: AI-based models have demonstrated good diagnostic performance, potentially being an important aid in CL detection. Some limitations of these studies are related to the size and heterogeneity of the datasets. Future studies need to rely on comparable, large, and clinically meaningful datasets.

Physicians’ awareness to new developments in AI research is important to define the best practices and scope of integrating AI-enabled technologies within a clinical setting. Objectives: To analyze the characteristics and trends of AI skin cancer publications from dermatology journals. Methods: AI skin cancer publications were retrieved in June 2022 from the Web of Science. Publications were screened by title, abstract, and keywords to assess eligibility. Publications were fully reviewed. Publications were divided between nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), melanoma, and skin cancer studies. The primary measured outcome was the number of citations. The secondary measured outcomes were articles’ general characteristics and features related to AI. Results: A total of 168 articles were included: 25 on NMSC, 77 on melanoma, and 66 on skin cancer. The most common types of skin cancers were melanoma (134, 79.8%), basal cell carcinoma (61, 36.3%), and squamous cell carcinoma (45, 26.9%). All articles were published between 2000 and 2022, with 49 (29.2%) of them being published in 2021. Original studies that developed or assessed an algorithm predominantly used supervised learning (66, 97.0%) and deep neural networks (42, 67.7%). The most used imaging modalities were standard dermoscopy (76, 45.2%) and clinical images (39, 23.2%). Conclusions: Most publications focused on developing or assessing screening technologies with mainly deep neural network algorithms.

Therefore, this study employed a quasi-experimental research design and used Python graphing in programming education as an example to investigate the factors influencing the effectiveness of learners in applying ChatGPT to problem-solving. Findings: AI literacy significantly influences learners’ effectiveness in using ChatGPT to solve problems, with AI awareness and AI usage being key factors. The knowledge base of programming language significantly affects learners’ effectiveness in applying ChatGPT to solve programming problems. Learners’ cognitive level of ChatGPT significantly influences their effectiveness in applying ChatGPT to problem-solving, while usage intention does not have a significant impact.

This paper’s primary purpose is to design a multi-disease prediction system using AI-based metaheuristic approaches. Initially, the data is collected in the form of diverse classes, which include Id, gender, date of birth, etc. The data has been preprocessed, normalized, and graphically represented to improve its quality and detect any errors. Later, machine learning models, such as decision tree, extra tree classifier, extreme gradient boosting classifier, light gradient boosting machine classifier, random forest, and artificial neural network, are initially trained without optimizing hyperparameters and then fine-tuned by integrating various hyperparameter optimizers such as grid search CV, random search, hyperband, and genetic search. During experimentation, it is found that optimizing the models using random search optimizer computed the highest accuracy of 100% as compared to the rest of the hyperparameter optimizers. In the context of ‘Service Oriented Computing and Applications,’ our multi-disease prediction system offers valuable innovation.

We aim to compare the leukocyte differential performance of the Mindray MC-80 with that of the Sysmex DI-60 and the gold standard, manual microscopy. Methods: A total of 100 abnormal peripheral blood (PB) smears were compared across the MC-80, DI-60, and manual microscopy. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive value, and efficiency were calculated according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP12-A2 guidelines. Comparisons were made using Bland–Altman analysis and Passing-Bablok regression analysis. Additionally, within-run imprecision was evaluated using five samples, each with varying percentages of mature leukocytes and blasts, in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3 guidelines. Results: The within-run coefficient of variation (%CV) of the MC-80 for most cell classes in the five samples was lower than that of the DI-60. Sensitivities for the MC-80 ranged from 98.2% for nucleated red blood cells (NRBC) to 28.6% for reactive lymphocytes. The DI-60's sensitivities varied between 100% for basophils and reactive lymphocytes, and 11.1% for metamyelocytes. Both analyzers demonstrated high specificity, negative predictive value, and efficiency, with over 90% for most cell classes. However, the DI-60 showed relatively lower specificity for lymphocytes (73.2%) and lower efficiency for blasts and lymphocytes (80.1% and 78.6%, respectively) compared with the MC-80. Bland–Altman analysis indicated that the absolute mean differences (%) ranged from 0.01 to 4.57 in MC-80 versus manual differential and 0.01 to 3.39 in DI-60 versus manual differential. After verification by technicians, both analyzers exhibited a very high correlation (r = 0.90–1.00) with the manual differential results in neutrophils, lymphocytes, and blasts. Conclusions: The Mindray MC-80 demonstrated good performance for leukocyte differential in PB smears, notably exhibiting higher sensitivity for blasts identification than the DI-60. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2-s2.0-85182230042"

Specifically, we focus on autonomous optimization of the photolithography process, a critical bottleneck in the fabrication. This provides an outperforming scheduling method compared with the existing rule-based approach which requires diverse rules and engineer experience on adapting dynamic environments. Our purposing RL network was designed to make effective schedules aligning with layered structures of the planning and scheduling modules for mass production. In the training phase, historical production data is utilized to create a representative discrete event simulation environment. The RL agent, based on the Deep Q-Network, undergoes episodic training to learn optimal scheduling policies. To ensure safe and reliable scheduling decisions, we further introduce action filters and parallel competing schedulers. The performance of RL-based Scheduler (RLS) is compared to the Rule-Based Scheduler (RBS) over actual fabrication in a year-long period. Based on key performance indicators, we validate the RLS outperforms the RBS, with a remarkable improvement in step target matching, reduced setup times, and enhanced lot assignments.

However, little is known about their generalizability across European screening settings. We therefore investigated the discriminatory performances of an AI-based risk model in European screening settings. Methods: Using four European screening populations in three countries (Italy, Spain, Germany) screened between 2009 and 2020 for women aged 45–69, we performed a nested case-control study to assess the predictive performance of an AI-based risk model. In total, 739 women with incident breast cancers were included together with 7812 controls matched on year of study-entry. Mammographic features (density, microcalcifications, masses, left-right breast asymmetries of these features) were extracted using AI from negative digital mammograms at study-entry. Two-year absolute risks of breast cancer were predicted and assessed after two years of follow-up. Adjusted risk stratification performance metrics were reported per clinical guidelines. Findings: The overall adjusted Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (aAUC) of the AI risk model was 0.72 (95% CI 0.70–0.75) for breast cancers developed in four screening populations. In the 6.2% [529/8551] of women at high risk using the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines thresholds, cancers were more likely diagnosed after 2 years follow-up, risk-ratio (RR) 6.7 (95% CI 5.6–8.0), compared with the 69% [5907/8551] of women classified at general risk by the model. Similar risk-ratios were observed across levels of mammographic density. Interpretation: The AI risk model showed generalizable discriminatory performances across European populations and, predicted ∼30% of clinically relevant stage 2 and higher breast cancers in ∼6% of high-risk women who were sent home with a negative mammogram. Similar results were seen in women with fatty and dense breasts. Funding: Swedish Research Council. © 2023 The Author(s)","2-s2.0-85182384531"

Early scientific literature and discourse on AI for some reasons (either to allow AI to gain entry and acceptability in the mainstream scientific and technological arena) vehemently deny this ”human replacement agenda”. This thinking pattern unknowingly shaped current scientific literature, discourse, and a general understanding of what AI is and its development and applicability (reductionist thinking). This limits our understanding of both the beneficial and destructive capabilities of AI. But when considering a TD assessment on the developmental dynamic of AI, one would comfortably say, and must be bold to admit, that indeed AI intends to replace humans and is on course to fulfilling this. We see this AI human replacement agenda in intensified R&D efforts dedicated to developing powerful AI system of systems which massively augment human reasoning, most times far better. The inexhaustible list includes the AI replacement of formerly considered human-centric jobs, advanced autonomous weapon systems, killer robots and AI in warfare, intelligent facial recognition, biometric monitoring, integrating AI on biological, nuclear and space-based weapons systems, etc. If this is the direction AI is taking, then a secondary aim would surely arrive at integrating epistemology in AI or ”grant spirits” for AI systems. This is because a distinctive characteristic of a human is his spirit and one cannot replace humans with AI without creating proportionate or appropriate spirits for the AI systems. Sooner or later our AI systems would have epistemological functions and possess spirits. The place of the soul for such AI systems would be attained as well. If human knowledge, beliefs, voices, clips and laws can be preserved long after they are gone as is possible in smart digital technologies, then spirit-based AI would indeed cause these humans to live forever. If the feat of a spirit enamored AI is near, then why worry? Indeed when considering that humans possess good and bad spirits (from the epistemology of rational and irrational inertia) then these AI systems would of course have good or bad spirits and be bad or good AI. Would integrating a spirit into a rule-based or machine learning algorithmic structure of an AI system have benefits? Yes!, profound benefits too. A spirit-based AI would of course make possible the ”possession of feelings” by AI systems, a feat unattainable in both algorithmic, operational and inferential basis of AI systems today. This inability of AI systems to have feelings has continued to remain a major setback in the acceptability (indeed trust) and utilization of AI. As we agree that the spirit in AI is possible, then overlooking efforts aimed at making this possible or allowing AI to attain this level unhindered (admitting dangers of human involvement in AI) could pose a dangerous threat that can become highly destructive to mankind. This calls for critical supervision (TD-based ethical policing) and the accompanying of the evolution, development and applicability of AI hence venerating the need for human mediation in AI both as a major TD research subject and A discussion would be made on my approach which considers the synergy of critical systems heuristics (CSH) and systems engineering (Transdisciplinary Systems Engineering) to create ”Transdisciplinary AI” which would formulate methods of integrating ”human” epistemology in expert systems. Human epistemology is emphasized because by the maturity of this future nature of AI, there would be terms known as ”AI or machine epistemology” or ”AI or machine spirits”. The investigation begins with creating expert systems (knowledge-based systems) with these functions with plans of moving into robotics and other machine learning arena. Finally, to move the needle on what is considered permissible epistemology or permissible spirit of/in AI is a critical component of the study of human mediation and AI which must be given critical attention. This would be discussed as well. applicable function. © 2023 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85183032961"

Lung cancer detected at an early stage has a much better prognosis. The British Thoracic Society guideline on managing pulmonary nodules recommends using multivariable malignancy risk prediction models to assist in management. While these guidelines seem to be effective in clinical practice, recent data suggest that artificial intelligence (AI)-based malignant-nodule prediction solutions might outperform existing models. Methods and analysis This study is a prospective, observational multicentre study to assess the clinical utility of an AI-assisted CT-based lung cancer prediction tool (LCP) for managing incidental solid and part solid pulmonary nodule patients vs standard care. Two thousand patients will be recruited from 12 different UK hospitals. The primary outcome is the difference between standard care and LCP-guided care in terms of the rate of benign nodules and patients with cancer discharged straight after the assessment of the baseline CT scan. Secondary outcomes investigate adherence to clinical guidelines, other measures of changes to clinical management, patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Ethics and dissemination This study has been reviewed and given a favourable opinion by the South Central-Oxford C Research Ethics Committee in UK (REC reference number: 22/SC/0142). Study results will be available publicly following peer-reviewed publication in open-access journals. A patient and public involvement group workshop is planned before the study results are available to discuss best methods to disseminate the results.

However, they face numerous challenges such as adhering to standard operating procedures (SOPs), managing inventory, maintaining equipment quality, and optimizing time allocation. This research paper proposes a novel approach that harnesses the power of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to overcome these challenges. In this study, generative AI algorithms are employed to develop an intelligent system that assists healthcare field engineers in following SOPs accurately while being always compliant. This is aimed to ensure consistent and efficient procedures, leading to improved equipment performance and patient safety. Additionally, the system integrates generative AI techniques to uphold equipment quality. It transforms lengthy equipment manuals into interactive Q&A systems, enabling engineers to focus on their tasks and access key information as needed. This enhances engineer productivity and indirectly contributes to the equipment’s working quality. While from a use case perspective, generative AI seems to effectively solve the problem of manually referring SOPs, compliance manuals and product catalogs. There would be technology challenges (especially around Artificial Intelligence) like data security, geo-political influences on data governance, dependency on specific technology platforms in addition to maintaining such systems over time effectively. In summary, this research introduces an innovative solution to address challenges faced by healthcare field engineers through the application of generative AI. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, the proposed system enhances adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs), streamlines inventory management, improves equipment quality maintenance, and optimizes time management. The study’s outcomes contribute to the efficient implementation of SOP adherence and process guidelines, while also providing guidelines to tackle long-term challenges related to technology maintenance, ethical compliance of AI systems, mitigation of risks and data governance influenced by the dynamic geopolitical landscape. © 2024, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","2-s2.0-85180629085"

However, current diagnosis is solely based on symptoms and laboratory data despite its complex pathology, which easily leads to misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis by inexperienced doctors. Especially, CT pulmonary angiography, the gold standard method, is not widely available. In this study, we aim to establish a rapid and accurate screening model for pulmonary embolism using machine learning technology. Importantly, data required for disease prediction are easily accessed, including routine laboratory data and medical record information of patients. Methods: We extracted features from patients' routine laboratory results and medical records, including blood routine, biochemical group, blood coagulation routine and other test results, as well as symptoms and medical history information. Samples with a feature loss rate greater than 0.8 were deleted from the original database. Data from 4723 cases were retained, 231 of which were positive for pulmonary embolism. 50 features were retained through the positive and negative statistical hypothesis testing which was used to build the predictive model. In order to avoid identification as majority-class samples caused by the imbalance of sample proportion, we used the method of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to increase the amount of information on minority samples. Five typical machine learning algorithms were used to model the screening of pulmonary embolism, including Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Back Propagation Neural Networks. To evaluate model performance, sensitivity, specificity and AUC curve were analyzed as the main evaluation indicators. Furthermore, a baseline model was established using the characteristics of the pulmonary embolism guidelines as a comparison model. Results: We found that XGBoost showed better performance compared to other models, with the highest sensitivity and specificity (0.99 and 0.99, respectively). Moreover, it showed significant improvement in performance compared to the baseline model (sensitivity and specificity were 0.76 and 0.76 respectively). More important, our model showed low missed diagnosis rate (0.46) and high AUC value (0.992). Finally, the calculation time of our model is only about 0.05 s to obtain the possibility of pulmonary embolism. Conclusions: In this study, five machine learning classification models were established to assess the likelihood of patients suffering from pulmonary embolism, and the XGBoost model most significantly improved the precision, sensitivity, and AUC for pulmonary embolism screening. Collectively, we have established an AI-based model to accurately predict pulmonary embolism at early stage. © 2023","2-s2.0-85183466094"

Traditionally – before online databases, full-text search availability, and AI-based search tools – identifying relevant sources might have been considered a valuable contribution. However, top-tier information systems (IS) journals now demand more than descriptive reviews; they require authors to move beyond summarizing existing knowledge toward proposing innovative research directions, important research questions, new concepts, and interesting linkages among concepts. Despite adhering to rigorous methodological guidelines, many authors struggle to make conceptual leaps, that is, to elevate their literature reviews beyond description, to achieve a profound understanding, to provide explanations, or to develop a model. Authors may mistakenly prioritize hard work – like thorough literature search, analysis, and organization – over hard thinking, which is crucial for advancing theoretical contributions. With this in mind, I adopt the view that the literature is indeed qualitative data. I suggest that approaches that help make conceptual leaps in qualitative research can benefit literature review authors searching for inconsistencies in the extant literature and developing new questions, concepts, and linkages. Drawing upon qualitative research (Klag, M., and Langley, A., 2013. Approaching the conceptual leap in qualitative research. International Journal of Management Reviews. 15 (2), 149–166.), I unpack the process of conceptual leaping in the conduct of literature reviews. This process involves navigating dialectic tensions between knowing and not knowing, engagement and detachment, deliberation and serendipity, and self-expression and social connection. Effectively managing these tensions can help authors increase the impact and innovativeness of their literature reviews. © 2024 The Author(s)","2-s2.0-85185537507"

Specifically, we introduce a novel methodology, represented through a process diagram, which allows the definition of generative AI processes and functions with a focus on the rule-augmented approach. Our methodology separates various components of the generative AI process as blocks that can be used to generate an implementation data flow diagram. Building upon this framework, we utilize the concept of a dialogue process as a theoretical foundation. This is specifically applied to the interactions between a user and an AI-empowered software program, which is called “Med|Primary AI assistant” (Alpha Version at the time of writing), and provides symptom analysis and medical advice in the form of suggested diagnostics. By leveraging current advancements in natural language processing, a novel approach is proposed to define a blueprint of domain-specific knowledge and a context for instantiated advice generation. Our approach not only encompasses the interaction domain, but it also delves into specific content that is relevant to the user, offering a tailored and effective AI–user interaction experience within a medical context. Lastly, using an evaluation process based on rules, defined by context and dialogue theory, we outline an algorithmic approach to measure content and responses. © 2024 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85183441231"

Multiple retrospective studies have demonstrated the benefits of AI-based diagnostic solutions for prostate cancer that includes improved prostate cancer detection, quantification, grading, interobserver concordance, cost and time savings, and a potential to reduce pathologists' workload and enhance pathology laboratory workflow. One of the major milestones is the Food and Drug Administration approval of Paige prostate AI for a second review of prostate cancer diagnosed using core needle biopsies. However, implementation of these AI tools for routine prostate cancer diagnostics is still lacking. Some of the limiting factors include costly digital pathology workflow, lack of regulatory guidelines for deployment of AI, and lack of prospective studies demonstrating the actual benefits of AI algorithms. Apart from diagnosis, AI algorithms have the potential to uncover novel insights into understanding the biology of prostate cancer and enable better risk stratification, and prognostication.

In contrast to traditional model-based methods, data-driven AI-based models for auto-segmentation have shown high accuracy in early studies in research settings and controlled environment (single institution). Vendor-provided commercial AI models are made available as part of the integrated treatment planning system (TPS) or as a stand-alone tool that provides streamlined workflow interacting with the main TPS. These commercial tools have drawn clinics' attention thanks to their significant benefit in reducing the workload from manual contouring and shortening the duration of treatment planning. However, challenges occur when applying these commercial AI-based segmentation models to diverse clinical scenarios, particularly in uncontrolled environments. Contouring nomenclature and guideline standardization has been the main task undertaken by the NRG Oncology. AI auto-segmentation holds the potential clinical trial participants to reduce interobserver variations, nomenclature non-compliance, and contouring guideline deviations. Meanwhile, trial reviewers could use AI tools to verify contour accuracy and compliance of those submitted datasets. In recognizing the growing clinical utilization and potential of these commercial AI auto-segmentation tools, NRG Oncology has formed a working group to evaluate the clinical utilization and potential of commercial AI auto-segmentation tools. The group will assess in-house and commercially available AI models, evaluation metrics, clinical challenges, and limitations, as well as future developments in addressing these challenges. General recommendations are made in terms of the implementation of these commercial AI models, as well as precautions in recognizing the challenges and limitations. © 2023","2-s2.0-85184062865"

We aimed at systematically reviewing the role of AI in IBD endoscopy and identifying future research areas. Methods: We searched the PubMed and Embase database using keywords (“artificial intelligence” OR “machine learning” OR “computer-aided” OR “convolutional neural network”) AND (“inflammatory bowel disease” OR “ulcerative colitis” OR “Crohn’s”) AND (“endoscopy” or “colonoscopy” or “capsule endoscopy” or “device assisted enteroscopy”) between 1975 and September 2023 and identified 62 original articles for detailed review. Review articles, consensus guidelines, case reports/series, editorials, letter to the editor, non-peer-reviewed pre-prints and conference abstracts were excluded. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the MI-CLAIM checklist. Results: The accuracy of AI models (25 studies) to assess ulcerative colitis (UC) endoscopic activity ranged between 86.54% and 94.5%. AI-assisted capsule endoscopy reading (12 studies) substantially reduced analyzable images and reading time with excellent accuracy (90.5% to 99.9%). AI-assisted analysis of colonoscopic images can help differentiate IBD from non-IBD, UC from non-UC and UC from Crohn’s disease (CD) (three studies) with 72.1%, 98.3% and > 90% accuracy, respectively. AI models based on non-invasive clinical and radiologic parameters could predict endoscopic activity (three studies). AI-assisted virtual chromoendoscopy (four studies) could predict histologic remission and long-term outcomes. Computer-assisted detection (CADe) of dysplasia (two studies) is feasible along with AI-based differentiation of high from low-grade IBD neoplasia (79% accuracy). AI is effective in linking electronic medical record data (two studies) with colonoscopic videos to facilitate widespread machine learning. Conclusion: AI-assisted IBD endoscopy has the potential to impact clinical management by automated detection and characterization of endoscopic lesions. Large, multi-center, prospective studies and commercially available IBD-specific endoscopic AI algorithms are warranted.

However, many accounting systems are yet to catch up with current technological developments. Thus, artificial intelligence (AI) in financial accounting is often applied only in pilot projects. Using AI-based forecasts in accounting enables proactive management and detailed analysis. However, thus far, there is little knowledge about which prediction models have already been evaluated for accounting problems. Given this lack of research, our study aims to summarize existing findings on how AI is used for forecasting purposes in financial accounting. Therefore, the authors aim to provide a comprehensive overview and agenda for future researchers to gain more generalizable knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: The authors identify existing research on AI-based forecasting in financial accounting by conducting a systematic literature review. For this purpose, the authors used Scopus and Web of Science as scientific databases. The data collection resulted in a final sample size of 47 studies. These studies were analyzed regarding their forecasting purpose, sample size, period and applied machine learning algorithms. Findings: The authors identified three application areas and presented details regarding the accuracy and AI methods used. Our findings show that sociotechnical and generalizable knowledge is still missing. Therefore, the authors also develop an open research agenda that future researchers can address to enable the more frequent and efficient use of AI-based forecasts in financial accounting. Research limitations/implications: Owing to the rapid development of AI algorithms, our results can only provide an overview of the current state of research. Therefore, it is likely that new AI algorithms will be applied, which have not yet been covered in existing research. However, interested researchers can use our findings and future research agenda to develop this field further. Practical implications: Given the high relevance of AI in financial accounting, our results have several implications and potential benefits for practitioners. First, the authors provide an overview of AI algorithms used in different accounting use cases. Based on this overview, companies can evaluate the AI algorithms that are most suitable for their practical needs. Second, practitioners can use our results as a benchmark of what prediction accuracy is achievable and should strive for. Finally, our study identified several blind spots in the research, such as ensuring employee acceptance of machine learning algorithms in companies. However, companies should consider this to implement AI in financial accounting successfully. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet been conducted that provided a comprehensive overview of AI-based forecasting in financial accounting. Given the high potential of AI in accounting, the authors aimed to bridge this research gap. Moreover, our cross-application view provides general insights into the superiority of specific algorithms. © 2023, Marko Kureljusic and Erik Karger.","2-s2.0-85158128751"

Leveraging AI for dynamic prediction has the potential to revolutionize risk stratification and provide personalized decision support for DAPT management. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed and validated a new AI-based pipeline using retrospective data of drug-eluting stent-treated patients, sourced from the Cerner Health Facts data set (n=98 236) and Optum’s de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart Database (n=9978). The 36 months following drug-eluting stent implantation were designated as our primary forecasting interval, further segmented into 6 sequential prediction windows. We evaluated 5 distinct AI algorithms for their precision in predicting ischemic and bleeding risks. Model discriminative accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, among other metrics. The weighted light gradient boosting machine stood out as the preeminent model, thus earning its place as our AI-DAPT model. The AI-DAPT demonstrated peak accuracy in the 30 to 36 months window, charting an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 90% [95% CI, 88%–92%] for ischemia and 84% [95% CI, 82%–87%] for bleeding predictions. CONCLUSIONS: Our AI-DAPT excels in formulating iterative, refined dynamic predictions by assimilating ongoing updates from patients’ clinical profiles, holding value as a novel smart clinical tool to facilitate optimal DAPT duration management with high accuracy and adaptability. © 2024 The Authors.","2-s2.0-85184295652"

A substantial quantity of spheroids is crucial for obtaining dependable results in high-throughput screening. Conventional fabrication methods of spheroid have limitations in low yield and morphological variation. Droplet-based microfluidic system capable of mass-producing uniformed spheroids can overcome these limitations. In this study, we investigated the optimal culture conditions, which allows to researchers provide guidelines for producing spheroids with the desired diameter and quantity. Mass-produced spheroids were employed to analyze compaction, which is crucial for evaluating the remission effects of drugs, as well as the formation of a necrotic core, which induces a bias in the analysis of drug response and viability. The time point at which compaction is completed and the diameter begins to increase was measured using spheroids with diameters of both > 400 μm and < 400 μm, and spheroids do not proliferate a linear growth trend. Spheroid with diameters ranging from 73.4 ± 11.42 μm to 371 ± 5.11 μm was used to predict the formation of the necrotic core based on live cell counting, and diameter of 300–330 μm was mathematically calculated as the diameter where a necrotic core forms. Additionally, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for high-throughput analysis is crucial for obtaining time-saving and reproducible data. We produced BT474 and MCF-7 spheroids with diameters of 100, 200, and 300 μm and obtained morphological indicators from an AI-based program to compare the differences in heterogeneous breast tumor spheroids. Through this study, we optimized the diameter of spheroids and the initiation timing for drug screening and emphasized the importance of AI-based morphological analysis in high-throughput screening. © The Korean BioChip Society 2024.","2-s2.0-85185488475"

Materials and methods: Guidelines on orthognathic surgery were reviewed, and a list of questions for patients to ask chatbots was produced by two reasearchers. The questions were categorized into 'General Information and Procedure' and 'Results and Recovery', with 30 questions in each category. Five different scoring criteria were used to evaluate the chatbot responses to 60 questions: Ensuring Quality Information for Patients (EQIP) tool, Reliability Scoring System (adapted from DISCERN), Global Quality Scale (GQS), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) and Similarity Index. Results: The highest mean values were observed in OpenEvidence for EQIP tool, SMOG, and Similarity Index, while for Reliability and GQS assessment criteria, MediSearch showed the highest values. When evaluated in terms of reliability and quality, all three AI-based chatbots demonstrated high reliability and good quality; however, they required at least a college-level education for readability based on the SMOG index. Additionally, upon assessment of similarity, ChatGPT-4 displayed high originality, while OpenEvidence exhibited a high degree of similarity. Conclusion: AI-based chatbots with a variety of features have usually provided answers with high quality, reliability, and difficult readability to questions. Although the medical information in the field of orthognathic surgery provided through chatbots is of higher quality, it is recommended that individuals consult their healthcare professionals on this issue. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS","2-s2.0-85182902313"

This paper aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based-deep learning models for breast cancer detection. Methods: We used the PICO (Patient/Population/Problem, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) scheme to formulate the research question and construct our search terms. Studies were systematically examined from the available literature using the constructed search terms from PubMed, and ScienceDirect according to the PRISMA guidelines. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 checklist. The characteristics of each included study such as the study design, population, index test, and reference standard, were extracted. The sensitivity, specificity, and AUC for each study were also reported. Results: In this systematic review, 14 studies were analyzed. Eight studies showed that AI was more accurate than radiologists in evaluating mammographic images, while one comprehensive study found AI to be less precise. Studies that reported sensitivity and specificity without radiologist intervention showed performance scores ranging from 16.0% to 89.71%. With radiologist intervention, sensitivity was between 62% to 86%. Only three studies reported a specificity of 73.5% to 79%. The AUC of the studies was between 0.79 and 0.95. Thirteen studies were retrospective, and one was prospective. Conclusion: There's inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of AI-based deep learning for breast cancer screening in clinical settings. More research is needed, including studies evaluating accuracy, RCTs, and large-scale cohort studies. This systematic review found that AI-based deep learning improves radiologists' accuracy, especially for novice radiologists. Younger, tech-savvy clinicians may be more accepting of AI. Although it can't replace radiologists, the encouraging results suggest it will play a significant role in identifying breast cancer in the future.

A shortfall in specialised workforce has been identified as the most significant barrier to expanding radiotherapy capacity. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based software has been developed to automate both the delineation of anatomical target structures and the definition of the position, size and shape of the radiation beams. Proposed advantages include improved treatment accuracy, as well as a reduction in the time (from weeks to minutes) and human resources needed to deliver radiotherapy. Methods ARCHERY is a non-randomised prospective study to evaluate the quality and economic impact of AI-based automated radiotherapy treatment planning for cervical, head and neck, and prostate cancers, which are endemic in LMICs, and for which radiotherapy is the primary curative treatment modality. The sample size of 990 patients (330 for each cancer type) has been calculated based on an estimated 95% treatment plan acceptability rate. Time and cost savings will be analysed as secondary outcome measures using the time-driven activity-based costing model. The 48-month study will take place in six public sector cancer hospitals in India (n=2), Jordan (n=1), Malaysia (n=1) and South Africa (n=2) to support implementation of the software in LMICs. Ethics and dissemination The study has received ethical approval from University College London (UCL) and each of the six study sites. If the study objectives are met, the AI-based software will be offered as a not-for-profit web service to public sector state hospitals in LMICs to support expansion of high quality radiotherapy capacity, improving access to and affordability of this key modality of cancer cure and control.

The use of mobile apps and technology for the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 has been the subject of numerous investigations, although no thorough analysis of COVID-19 pandemic prevention has been conducted using mobile apps, creating a gap. Objective: With the intention of helping software companies and clinical researchers, this study provides comprehensive information regarding the different fields in which mobile apps were used to diagnose COVID-19 during the pandemic. Methods: In this systematic review, 535 studies were found after searching 5 major research databases (ScienceDirect, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and IEEE). Of these, only 42 (7.9%) studies concerned with diagnosing and detecting COVID-19 were chosen after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocol. Results: Mobile apps were categorized into 6 areas based on the content of these 42 studies: contact tracing, data gathering, data visualization, artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnosis, rule- and guideline-based diagnosis, and data transformation. Patients with COVID-19 were identified via mobile apps using a variety of clinical, geographic, demographic, radiological, serological, and laboratory data. Most studies concentrated on using AI methods to identify people who might have COVID-19. Additionally, symptoms, cough sounds, and radiological images were used more frequently compared to other data types. Deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks, performed comparatively better in the processing of health care data than other types of AI techniques, which improved the diagnosis of COVID-19. Conclusions: Mobile apps could soon play a significant role as a powerful tool for data collection, epidemic health data analysis, and the early identification of suspected cases. These technologies can work with the internet of things, cloud storage, 5th-generation technology, and cloud computing. Processing pipelines can be moved to mobile device processing cores using new deep learning methods, such as lightweight neural networks. In the event of future pandemics, mobile apps will play a critical role in rapid diagnosis using various image data and clinical symptoms. Consequently, the rapid diagnosis of these diseases can improve the management of their effects and obtain excellent results in treating patients. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

However, it has not yet been determined whether such model performance is driven by latent audio biomarkers with true causal links to SARS-CoV-2 infection or by confounding effects, such as recruitment bias, present in observational studies. Here we undertake a large-scale study of audio-based AI classifiers as part of the UK government’s pandemic response. We collect a dataset of audio recordings from 67,842 individuals, with linked metadata, of whom 23,514 had positive polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-CoV-2. In an unadjusted analysis, similar to that in previous works, AI classifiers predict SARS-CoV-2 infection status with high accuracy (ROC–AUC = 0.846 [0.838–0.854]). However, after matching on measured confounders, such as self-reported symptoms, performance is much weaker (ROC–AUC = 0.619 [0.594–0.644]). Upon quantifying the utility of audio-based classifiers in practical settings, we find them to be outperformed by predictions on the basis of user-reported symptoms. We make best-practice recommendations for handling recruitment bias, and for assessing audio-based classifiers by their utility in relevant practical settings.

However, despite the inevitable benefits of all these key technologies, the heterogeneous and ultra-flexible structure of the 5G and beyond network brings non-orthogonality into the system and generates significant interference that needs to be handled carefully. Therefore, it is essential to design effective interference management schemes to mitigate severe and sometimes unpredictable interference in mobile networks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of interference management in 5G and Beyond networks and discuss its future evolution. We start with a unified classification and a detailed explanation of the different types of interference and continue by presenting our taxonomy of existing interference management approaches. Then, after explaining interference measurement reports and signaling, we provide for each type of interference identified, an in-depth literature review and technical discussion of appropriate management schemes. We finish by discussing the main interference challenges that will be encountered in future 6G networks and by presenting insights on the suggested new interference management approaches, including useful guidelines for an AI-based solution. This review will provide a first-hand guide to the industry in determining the most relevant technology for interference management, and will also allow for consideration of future challenges and research directions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85181586149"

The discourse on AI is part of what we call the “authenticity negotiation process” through which AI’s “intelligence” is given a particular meaning and value. This has implications for scientific theory, research directions, ethical guidelines, design principles, funding, media attention, and the way people relate to and act upon AI. It also has great impact on humanity’s self-image and the way we negotiate what it means to be human, existentially, culturally, politically, and legally. We use a discourse analysis of academic papers, AI education programs, and online discussions to demonstrate how AI itself, as well as the products, services, and decisions delivered by AI systems are negotiated as authentic or inauthentic intelligence. In this negotiation process, AI stakeholders indirectly define and essentialize what being human(like) means. The main argument we will develop is that this process of indirectly defining and essentializing humans results in an elimination of the space for humans to be indeterminate. By eliminating this space and, hence, denying indeterminacy, the existential condition of the human being is jeopardized. Rather than re-creating humanity in AI, the AI discourse is re-defining what it means to be human and how humanity is valued and should be treated. © The Author(s) 2024.","2-s2.0-85185939821"

Especially in the medical domain, where validation of methodologies and outcomes is as important as the adoption rate of such systems, the requirements of the depth and the level of abstraction of the explainability are particularly important and necessitate a systemic approach to ensure a proper definition. Explainability and interpretability are important usability and trustworthiness properties of AI-empowered systems and, as such, constitute important factors for technology acceptance. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for explainability requirements in AI-empowered systems using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). This framework employs targeted ML (hierarchical clustering, k-means or other) to acquire a user model for personalised, multi-layered explainability. Our novel framework integrates a rule-based system, which guides the degree of trustworthiness to be achieved based on user perception and AI literacy level. We test this methodology in the case of AI-empowered medical systems to (1) assess and quantify the doctors’ abilities and familiarisation with technology and AI, (2) generate layers of personalised explainability based on user ability and user needs in terms of trustworthiness and (3) provide the necessary environment for transparency and validation. To assess and quantify the doctors’ abilities we have considered Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) a tool commonly used in the medical domain to bridge the communication gap between patients and doctors. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85184472514"

BCC is the most common type of skin cancer, and its incidence is increasing rapidly worldwide. AI can play a significant role in reducing the time and effort required for BCC diagnostics and thus improve the overall efficiency of the process. To train such an AI system in a fully-supervised fashion however, would require a large amount of pixel-level annotation by already strained dermatopathologists. Therefore, in this study, our primary objective was to develop a weakly-supervised for the identification of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and the stratification of BCC into low-risk and high-risk categories within histopathology whole-slide images (WSI). We compared Clustering-constrained Attention Multiple instance learning (CLAM) with StreamingCLAM and hypothesized that the latter would be the superior approach. A total of 5147 images were used to train and validate the models, which were subsequently tested on an internal set of 949 images and an external set of 183 images. The labels for training were automatically extracted from free-text pathology reports using a rule-based approach. All data has been made available through the COBRA dataset. The results showed that both the CLAM and StreamingCLAM models achieved high performance for the detection of BCC, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.994 and 0.997, respectively, on the internal test set and 0.983 and 0.993 on the external dataset. Furthermore, the models performed well on risk stratification, with AUC values of 0.912 and 0.931, respectively, on the internal set, and 0.851 and 0.883 on the external set. In every single metric the StreamingCLAM model outperformed the CLAM model or is on par. The performance of both models was comparable to that of two pathologists who scored 240 BCC positive slides. Additionally, in the public test set, StreamingCLAM demonstrated a comparable AUC of 0.958, markedly superior to CLAM's 0.803. This difference was statistically significant and emphasized the strength and better adaptability of the StreamingCLAM approach. © 2023","2-s2.0-85182405222"

Diabetic eye illness is identified as one of the most common reasons for vision loss among people. To properly manage DR, there has been immense research and exploration of state-of-the-art methods using artificial intelligence (AI) enabled models. Specifically, AI-empowered models combine multiple machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based algorithms to improve the performance of the developed system architectures that are commercially utilized for the detection of DR disease. However, these models still exhibit several limitations, such as computational complexity, low accuracy in DR stage detection due to class imbalance, more time consumption, and high maintenance cost. To overcome these limits, a more advanced model is required to accurately predict the DR stage in the initial stages. For example, the identification of DR disease in the initial stage helps the ophthalmologist to make an accurate and safe diagnosis, and thereby, eyesight-related issues may be treated more effectively. This study conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to provide a detailed discussion of the background of diabetic retinopathy, its major causes, challenges faced by ophthalmologists in DR detection, and possible solutions for identifying DR in the initial stage. Also, the SLR provides an in-depth analysis of the existing state-of-the-art techniques and system models used in DR diagnosis based on AI, ML, and recently developed DL-based approaches. Furthermore, this present survey would be helpful for the research community to receive information on the recent approaches used for DR identification along with their significant challenges and limitations. © 2024 The Authors","2-s2.0-85184074368"

In pursuit of advancing the field of autonomous UV-C disinfection robotics, we conducted two comprehensive state-of-the-art analyses: the first one in the literature and the second one in existing commercial disinfection robots to identify current challenges. Of all of the challenges, we consider the most outstanding ones to be safeguarding humans and animals and understanding the surroundings while operating the disinfection process challenges that we will address in this article. While UV-C lamps have demonstrated their effectiveness in sterilizing air and surfaces, the field of autonomous UV-C disinfection robotics represents a critical domain that requires advancement, particularly in safeguarding the wellbeing of humans and animals during operation. Operating UV-C disinfection robots in close proximity to humans or animals introduces inherent risks, and existing disinfection robots often fall short in incorporating advanced safety systems. In response to these challenges, we propose the RoboCoV Cleaner—an indoor autonomous UV-C disinfection robot equipped with an advanced dual and redundant safety system. This novel approach incorporates multiple passive infrared (PIR) sensors and AI object detection on a 360-degree camera. Under our test, the dual-redundant system reached more than 90% when detecting humans with high accuracy using the AI system 99% up to 30 m away in a university hallway (different light conditions) combined with the PIR system (with lower accuracy). The PIR system was proved to be a redundant system for uninterrupted operation during communication challenges, ensuring continuous sensor information collection with a swift response time of 50 ms (image processing within 200 ms). It empowers the robot to detect and react to human presence, even under challenging conditions, such as when individuals wear masks, in complete darkness, under UV light, or in environments with blurred visual conditions. In our test, the detection system performed outstandingly well with up to 99% detection rate of humans. Beyond safety features, the RoboCoV Cleaner can identify objects in its surroundings. This capability empowers the robot to discern objects affected by UV-C light, enabling it to apply specialized rules for targeted disinfection. The proposed system exhibits a wide range of capabilities beyond its core purpose of disinfection, making it suitable for healthcare facilities, universities, conference venues, and hospitals. Its implementation has the ability to improve significantly human safety and protect people. By showcasing the RoboCoV Cleaner’s safety-first approach and adaptability, we aim to set a new benchmark for UV-C disinfection robots, promoting clean and secure environments while protecting vulnerable people, even in challenging scenarios. © 2024 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85184655505"

A machine learning model [LAT-artificial intelligence (AI)] was developed to predict the presence of LAT based on clinical and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) features. Methods and results Data from a 13-site prospective registry of patients who underwent TOE before cardioversion or catheter ablation were used. LAT-AI was trained to predict LAT using data from 12 sites (n = 2827) and tested externally in patients on chronic OAC from two sites (n = 1284). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of LAT-AI were compared with that of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and CHA2DS2-VASc score. A decision threshold allowing for a 99% negative predictive value was defined in the development cohort. A protocol where TOE in patients on chronic OAC is performed depending on the LAT-AI score was validated in the external cohort. In the external testing cohort, LAT was found in 5.5% of patients. LAT-AI achieved an AUC of 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.82-0.89], outperforming LVEF (0.81, 95% CI 0.76-0.86, P < .0001) and CHA2DS2-VASc score (0.69, 95% CI: 0.63-0.7, P < .0001) in the entire external cohort. Based on the proposed protocol, 40% of patients on chronic OAC from the external cohort would safely avoid TOE. Conclusion LAT-AI allows accurate prediction of LAT. A LAT-AI-based protocol could be used to guide the decision to perform TOE despite chronic OAC.  © The Author(s) 2023.","2-s2.0-85181376790"

This challenge is twofold: 1) computational. because non-periodicity and defects render constructing design guidelines between geometries and mechanical properties complex and expensive and 2) experimental. because the fabrication and characterization of complex, often hierarchical and non-periodic 3D architectures is non-trivial. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","2-s2.0-85184237573"

Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) tehcnologies ease and automate the analysis of large policy-related datasets, which helps policymakers to realize a shift toward data-driven decisions. Nevertheless, the deployment and use of AI tools for public policy development is also associated with significant technical, political, and operation challenges. For instance, AI-based policy development solutions must be transparent and explainable to policymakers, while at the same time adhering to the mandates of emerging regulations such as the AI Act of the European Union. This paper introduces some of the main technical, operational, regulatory compliance challenges of AI-based policymaking. Accordingly, it introduces technological solutions for overcoming them, including: (i) a reference architecture for AI-based policy development, (ii) a virtualized cloud-based tool for the specification and implementation of ML-based data-driven policies, (iii) a ML framework that enables the development of transparent and explainable ML models for policymaking, and (iv) a set of guidelines for using the introduced technical solutions to achieve regulatory compliance. The paper ends up illustrating the validation and use of the introduced solutions in real-life public policymaking cases for various local governments.  © 2024 The Author(s).

However, low acceptability of AI as a digital healthcare intervention among medical professionals threatens to undermine user uptake levels, hinder meaningful and optimal value-added engagement, and ultimately prevent these promising benefits from being realised. Understanding the factors underpinning AI acceptability will be vital for medical institutions to pinpoint areas of deficiency and improvement within their AI implementation strategies. This scoping review aims to survey the literature to provide a comprehensive summary of the key factors influencing AI acceptability among healthcare professionals in medical imaging domains and the different approaches which have been taken to investigate them. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed across five academic databases including Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Compendex, and Scopus from January 2013 to September 2023. This was done in adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Overall, 31 articles were deemed appropriate for inclusion in the scoping review. Results: The literature has converged towards three overarching categories of factors underpinning AI acceptability including: user factors involving trust, system understanding, AI literacy, and technology receptiveness; system usage factors entailing value proposition, self-efficacy, burden, and workflow integration; and socio-organisational-cultural factors encompassing social influence, organisational readiness, ethicality, and perceived threat to professional identity. Yet, numerous studies have overlooked a meaningful subset of these factors that are integral to the use of medical AI systems such as the impact on clinical workflow practices, trust based on perceived risk and safety, and compatibility with the norms of medical professions. This is attributable to reliance on theoretical frameworks or ad-hoc approaches which do not explicitly account for healthcare-specific factors, the novelties of AI as software as a medical device (SaMD), and the nuances of human-AI interaction from the perspective of medical professionals rather than lay consumer or business end users. Conclusion: This is the first scoping review to survey the health informatics literature around the key factors influencing the acceptability of AI as a digital healthcare intervention in medical imaging contexts. The factors identified in this review suggest that existing theoretical frameworks used to study AI acceptability need to be modified to better capture the nuances of AI deployment in healthcare contexts where the user is a healthcare professional influenced by expert knowledge and disciplinary norms. Increasing AI acceptability among medical professionals will critically require designing human-centred AI systems which go beyond high algorithmic performance to consider accessibility to users with varying degrees of AI literacy, clinical workflow practices, the institutional and deployment context, and the cultural, ethical, and safety norms of healthcare professions. As investment into AI for healthcare increases, it would be valuable to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the causal contribution of these factors to achieving high levels of AI acceptability among medical professionals. © 2023 The Author(s)","2-s2.0-85180484311"

Safety guidelines provided by Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) aim to address construction safety concerns, but limitations persist, especially in the context of workers safety and the transportation of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and Micro Reactors (MRs) in the nuclear construction domain. This research focuses on identifying issues related to safety guidelines in nuclear construction and aims to develop new guidelines and strengthen existing ones. Through a critical literature review, key factors influencing safety in nuclear construction were identified. A questionnaire survey was prepared in line with those identified key safety factors and distributed among 40 professionals from the United States to gather feedback on these factors in countering safety issues and developing new guidelines in the context of nuclear construction. The findings reveal a lack of specific guidelines concerning the safe transportation of SMRs and MRs, as well as a gap in understanding accidents during the construction and transportation phases of nuclear projects. The results of this research contribute to enhancing safety protocols and addressing the unique challenges faced in nuclear construction. The research has also highlighted the importance of digital technology tools such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as emerging digital tools, which could be helpful to counter safety concerns linked to SMRs and MRs in future.

However, the rapid proliferation and dynamism of today's cyber threats in digital environments may disrupt CI functionalities, which would have a debilitating impact on public safety, economic stability, and national security. This has led to much interest in effective cybersecurity solutions regarding automation and intelligent decision-making, where AI-based modeling is potentially significant. In this paper, we take into account “Rule-based AI” rather than other black-box solutions since model transparency, i.e., human interpretation, explainability, and trustworthiness in decision-making, is an essential factor, particularly in cybersecurity application areas. This article provides an in-depth study on multi-aspect rule based AI modeling considering human interpretable decisions as well as security automation and intelligence for CI. We also provide a taxonomy of rule generation methods by taking into account not only knowledge-driven approaches based on human expertise but also data-driven approaches, i.e., extracting insights or useful knowledge from data, and their hybridization. This understanding can help security analysts and professionals comprehend how systems work, identify potential threats and anomalies, and make better decisions in various real-world application areas. We also cover how these techniques can address diverse cybersecurity concerns such as threat detection, mitigation, prediction, diagnosis for root cause findings, and so on in different CI sectors, such as energy, defence, transport, health, water, agriculture, etc. We conclude this paper with a list of identified issues and opportunities for future research, as well as their potential solution directions for how researchers and professionals might tackle future generation cybersecurity modeling in this emerging area of study. © 2024 The Author(s)","2-s2.0-85184885846"

Cyber–physical attacks against the physical process are difficult to detect using existing threats and attack intelligence due to the (1) lack of such intelligence for the physical process and operational technology systems and (2) such attacks affect the process parameters and states. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based attack intelligence is required. This study proposes an attack intelligence framework for identifying cyber–physical attacks and extracting attack intelligence. We propose an attribution module for attack identification using various machine and deep learning algorithms. We also utilize Explainable AI (XAI) to improve the explainability of the attack attribution module and extract attack intelligence.

Research to ensure the proper design, implementation, and uptake of chatbots is imperative. Inclusive digital health research and responsible AI integration into health care require active and sustained patient and stakeholder engagement, yet corresponding activities and guidance are limited for this purpose. Objective: In response, this manuscript presents a master protocol for the development, testing, and implementation of a chatbot family in partnership with stakeholders. This protocol aims to help efficiently translate an initial chatbot intervention (MARVIN) to multiple health domains and populations. Methods: The MARVIN chatbots study has an adaptive platform trial design consisting of multiple parallel individual chatbot substudies with four common objectives: (1) co-construct a tailored AI chatbot for a specific health care setting, (2) assess its usability with a small sample of participants, (3) measure implementation outcomes (usability, acceptability, appropriateness, adoption, and fidelity) within a large sample, and (4) evaluate the impact of patient and stakeholder partnerships on chatbot development. For objective 1, a needs assessment will be conducted within the setting, involving four 2-hour focus groups with 5 participants each. Then, a co-construction design committee will be formed with patient partners, health care professionals, and researchers who will participate in 6 workshops for chatbot development, testing, and improvement. For objective 2, a total of 30 participants will interact with the prototype for 3 weeks and assess its usability through a survey and 3 focus groups. Positive usability outcomes will lead to the initiation of objective 3, whereby the public will be able to access the chatbot for a 12-month real-world implementation study using web-based questionnaires to measure usability, acceptability, and appropriateness for 150 participants and meta-use data to inform adoption and fidelity. After each objective, for objective 4, focus groups will be conducted with the design committee to better understand their perspectives on the engagement process. Results: From July 2022 to October 2023, this master protocol led to four substudies conducted at the McGill University Health Centre or the Centre hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal (both in Montreal, Quebec, Canada): (1) MARVIN for HIV (large-scale implementation expected in mid-2024), (2) MARVIN-Pharma for community pharmacists providing HIV care (usability study planned for mid-2024), (3) MARVINA for breast cancer, and (4) MARVIN-CHAMP for pediatric infectious conditions (both in preparation, with development to begin in early 2024). Conclusions: This master protocol offers an approach to chatbot development in partnership with patients and health care professionals that includes a comprehensive assessment of implementation outcomes. It also contributes to best practice recommendations for patient and stakeholder engagement in digital health research. © Yuanchao Ma, Sofiane Achiche, Marie-Pascale Pomey, Jesseca Paquette, Nesrine Adjtoutah, Serge Vicente, Kim Engler, MARVIN chatbots MARVIN chatbots Patient Expert Committee, Moustafa Laymouna, David Lessard, Benoît Lemire, Jamil Asselah, Rachel Therrien, Esli Osmanlliu, Ma'n H Zawati, Yann Joly, Bertrand Lebouché.","2-s2.0-85186108595"

Despite Sweden's advanced digitalization efforts and the widespread application of AI in the public sector, our study reveals significant gaps between theoretical ambitions and practical outcomes, particularly in the context of AI's trustworthiness. We employ a robust theoretical framework comprising Institutional Theory, the Resource-Based View (RBV), and Ambidexterity Theory, to analyze the challenges and discrepancies in AI implementation within PES. Our analysis shows that while AI promises enhanced decision-making efficiency, the reality is marred by issues of transparency, interpretability, and stakeholder engagement. The opacity of the neural network used by the agency to assess jobseekers’ need for support and the lack of comprehensive technical understanding among PES management contribute to the challenges in achieving transparent and interpretable AI systems. Economic pressures for efficiency often overshadow the need for ethical considerations and stakeholder involvement, leading to decisions that may not be in the best interest of jobseekers. We propose recommendations for enhancing AI's trustworthiness in public services, emphasizing the importance of stakeholder engagement, particularly involving jobseekers in the decision-making process. Our study advocates for a more nuanced balance between the use of advanced AI technologies and the leveraging of internal resources such as skilled personnel and organizational knowledge. We also highlight the need for improved AI literacy among both management and personnel to effectively navigate AI's integration into public decision-making processes. Our findings contribute to the ongoing debate on trustworthy AI, offering a detailed case study that bridges the gap between theoretical exploration and practical application. By scrutinizing the AI implementation in the Swedish PES, we provide valuable insights and guidelines for other public sector organizations grappling with the integration of AI into their decision-making processes. © 2024 The Authors","2-s2.0-85184027069"

While AI-based homecare systems are being developed, the perspectives of chronic patients, who are one of the primary beneficiaries and risk bearers of these technologies, remain largely under-researched. While recent research has highlighted the importance of AI-based homecare systems, the current understanding of patients’ desired designs and features is still limited. Objective: This paper explores chronic patients’ perspectives regarding AI-based homecare systems, an area currently underrepresented in research. We aim to identify the factors influencing their decision to use such systems, elucidate the potential roles of government and other concerned authorities, and provide feedback to AI developers to enhance adoption, system design, and usability and improve the overall healthcare experiences of chronic patients. Method: A web-based open-ended questionnaire was designed to gather the perspectives of chronic patients about AI-based homecare systems. In total, responses from 181 participants were collected. Using Krippendorff's clustering technique, an inductive thematic analysis was performed to identify the main themes and their respective subthemes. Result: Through rigorous coding and thematic analysis of the collected responses, we identified four major themes further segmented into thirteen subthemes. These four primary themes were: 1) “Personalized Design”, emphasizing the need for patients to manage their health condition better through personalized and educational resources and user-friendly interfaces; 2) “Emotional & Social Support”, underscoring the desire for AI systems to facilitate social connectivity and provide emotional support to improve the well-being of chronic patients at home; 3) “System Integration & Proactive Care”, addressing the importance of seamless communication, proactive patient monitoring and integration with existing healthcare platforms; and 4) “Ethics & Regulation”, prioritizing ethical guidelines, regulatory compliance, and affordability in the design.

An RRPDG is an ordered sequence of nodes, each characterized by stereotyped input and output parameters, encapsulating a transformation of the process state (<italic/>e.g.<italic/>, a manufacturing operation). RRPDG allow defining complex transformations by composing a set of nodes (<italic/>i.e.<italic/>, regions), hiding the internal details. Then, RRPDGs are used to automatically reasoning over dynamic reconfiguration and process optimization: an instance of the A-star search algorithm is used to search for possible transformations while pursuing an optimization function. The rules defined in this article over RRPDG models enforce the transformations&#x0027; correctness. We use RRPDGs to model a real production system while the transformation rules are applied to optimize the system&#x0027;s processes. The proposed representation reduced the search complexity in each experiment, allowing to reach an optimal solution also in the case for which classical approaches were unable to complete before reaching the timeout. In all the experiments, the cost of the solution produced by using the regionalized representation is minor than the the solution produced by using the classical representation.

Methods: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis between January 01, 2022 and August 01, 2023. A decision-analytic Markov model was constructed to simulate DR progression in a population of 1,197,818 non-Indigenous and 65,160 Indigenous Australians living with diabetes aged ≥20 years over 40 years. From a healthcare provider's perspective, we compared current practice to three primary care AI-based screening scenarios—(A) substitution of current manual grading, (B) scaling up to patient acceptance level, and (C) achieving universal screening. Study results were presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), benefit-cost ratio (BCR), and net monetary benefits (NMB). A Willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of AU$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and a discount rate of 3.5% were adopted in this study. Findings: With the status quo, the non-Indigenous diabetic population was projected to develop 96,269 blindness cases, resulting in AU$13,039.6 m spending on DR screening and treatment during 2020–2060. In comparison, all three intervention scenarios were effective and cost-saving. In particular, if a universal screening program was to be implemented (Scenario C), it would prevent 38,347 blindness cases, gain 172,090 QALYs and save AU$595.8 m, leading to a BCR of 3.96 and NMB of AU$9,200 m. Similar findings were also reported in the Indigenous population. With the status quo, 3,396 Indigenous individuals would develop blindness, which would cost the health system AU$796.0 m during 2020–2060. All three intervention scenarios were cost-saving for the Indigenous population. Notably, universal AI-based DR screening (Scenario C) would prevent 1,211 blindness cases and gain 9,800 QALYs in the Indigenous population, leading to a saving of AU$19.2 m with a BCR of 1.62 and NMB of AU$509 m. Interpretation: Our findings suggest that implementing AI-based DR screening in primary care is highly effective and cost-saving in both Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations.

Our proposed method accomplishes this through the knowlEdge architecture, which enables human operators to implement AI solutions using a zero-touch framework. It relies on containerized AI model training and execution, supported by a robust data pipeline and rounded off with human feedback and evaluation interfaces. The result is a platform built from a number of components, spanning all major areas of the AI lifecycle.

However, most contemporary reviews are focused on examining the usage of AI with a restricted quantity of data, analyzing only a subset of AI algorithms, or performing narrative work without analyzing all dedicated studies. Given the preceding, the goal of this work was to conduct a mini-review to determine the current state of AI-based systems as a support in UTI diagnosis. Recent Findings: There are sufficient publications to comprehend the potential applications of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis of UTIs. Existing research in this field, in general, publishes performance metrics that are exemplary. However, upon closer inspection, many of the available publications are burdened with flaws associated with the improper use of artificial intelligence, such as the use of a small number of samples, their lack of heterogeneity, and the absence of external validation. AI-based models cannot be classified as full-fledged physician assistants in diagnosing UTIs due to the fact that these limitations and flaws represent only a portion of all potential obstacles. Instead, such studies should be evaluated as exploratory, with a focus on the importance of future work that complies with all rules governing the use of AI. Summary: AI algorithms have demonstrated their potential for UTI diagnosis. However, further studies utilizing large, heterogeneous, prospectively collected datasets, as well as external validations, are required to define the actual clinical workflow value of artificial intelligence. © 2023, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85180259661"

Each high power field (HPF) patch of a WSI is inspected for the number of CB cells and compared with the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline that organizes lymphoma into 3 grades. Spotting and counting CBs is time-consuming and labor intensive. Moreover, there is often disagreement between different readers, and even a single reader may not be able to perform consistently due to many factors. Method: We propose an artificial intelligence system that can scan patches from a WSI and detect CBs automatically. The AI system works on the principle of object detection, where the CB is the single class of object of interest. We trained the AI model on 1,669 example instances of CBs that originate from WSI of 5 different patients. The data was split 80%/20% for training and validation respectively. Result: The best performance was from YOLOv5x6 model that used the preprocessed CB dataset achieved precision of 0.808, recall of 0.776, mAP at 0.5 IoU of 0.800 and overall mAP of 0.647. Discussion: The results show that centroblast cells can be detected in WSI with relatively high precision and recall.

However, achieving path-finding in non-convex complex environments without maps as well as enabling multiple robots to follow social rules for obstacle avoidance remain challenging problems. In this letter, we propose a socially aware mapless navigation algorithm, namely Safe Reinforcement Learning-Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (SRL-ORCA). This is a multi-Agent safe reinforcement learning algorithm by using ORCA as external knowledge to provide safety guarantees. This algorithm further introduces traffic norms of human society to improve social comfort and achieve cooperative avoidance by following human social customs. The result of experiments shows that SRL-ORCA learns strategies to obey specific traffic rules. Compared to RL, SRL-ORCA shows a significant improvement in navigation success rate in different complex scenarios. SRL-ORCA is able to cope with non-convex obstacle environments without falling into local minima and has a 14.5% improvement in average time to goal compared to ORCA.  © 2016 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85177051842"

The literature thus far has provided explanations that primarily focus on conscious reflective processes. Here, we supplement this view by taking an unconscious perspective that can be highly informative. Building on theories of implicit prejudice, in a preregistered study, we suggest that people develop an implicit bias (i.e., prejudice) against artificial intelligence (AI) systems, as a different and threatening “species,” the behavior of which is unknown. Like in other contexts of prejudice, we expected people to be guided by this implicit bias but try to override it. This leads to some willingness to rely on algorithmic advice (appreciation), which is reduced as a function of people’s implicit prejudice against the machine. Next, building on the somatic marker hypothesis and the accessibility-diagnosticity perspective, we provide an explanation as to why aversion is ephemeral. As people learn about the performance of an algorithm, they depend less on primal implicit biases when deciding whether to rely on the AI’s advice. Two studies (n1 = 675, n2 = 317) that use the implicit association test consistently support this view. Two additional studies (n3 = 255, n4 = 332) rule out alternative explanations and provide stronger support for our assertions. The findings ultimately suggest that moving the needle between aversion and appreciation depends initially on one’s general unconscious bias against AI because there is insufficient information to override it. They further suggest that in later use stages, this shift depends on accessibility to diagnostic information about the AI’s performance, which reduces the weight given to unconscious prejudice. © 2023 University of Minnesota.

Few scholars have researched teachers' perspectives on AI use due to a general lack of expertise on how it can be used in the classroom, as well as a lack of specific knowledge about what AI-adopted tools would be like. This study investigated mathematics teachers’ perceptions of implemented AI systems and applications in Abu Dhabi Emirate schools. The sample study consists of 580 male and female math teachers from public and private schools across three educational regions in Abu Dhabi selected based on several qualifications and experiences. The research followed the descriptive analytical approach due to its suitability to the study’s context. The results revealed that AI could be used as an educational tool to facilitate teaching and develop students’ performance by including AI systems and applications in the curricula. They increased motivation for learning, encouraging challenge, competition, and suspense among students and considering their differences. The results also showed the most critical challenges that math teachers face in applying AI systems and applications, the most prominent of which are the need to exert more effort than the traditional method when using different AI systems and applications and the pressures placed on them, which prevent them from using AI in teaching. Additionally, the findings revealed no statistically significant differences in mathematics teachers’ perspectives regarding the importance of using systems and applications of AI in teaching; however, statistically significant differences were found in the math teachers’ challenges when applying AI systems and applications in teaching according to the educational qualifications, especially among math teachers who have masters’ degrees. These results can be used as a foundation for creating guidelines for the future integration of AI education in schools since they report teachers’ experiences utilizing the system and various considerations regarding its implementation. © 2024 College of Education, Al-Iraqia University.

Yet, there is a limited understanding of how these advanced computational techniques are employed in cancer nursing to inform clinical practice. This review aimed to identify and synthesise evidence on artificial intelligence in cancer nursing. Methods: CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and PubMed were searched using key terms between January 2010 and December 2022. Titles, abstracts, and then full texts were screened against eligibility criteria, resulting in twenty studies being included. Critical appraisal was undertaken, and relevant data extracted and analysed. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Results: Artificial intelligence was used in numerous areas including breast, colorectal, liver, and ovarian cancer care among others. Algorithms were trained and tested on primary and secondary datasets to build predictive models of health problems related to cancer. Studies reported this led to improvements in the accuracy of predicting health outcomes or identifying variables that improved outcome prediction. While nurses led most studies, few deployed an artificial intelligence based digital tool with cancer nurses in a real-world setting as studies largely focused on developing and validating predictive models. Conclusion: Electronic cancer nursing datasets should be established to enable artificial intelligence techniques to be tested and if effective implemented in digital prediction and other AI-based tools. Cancer nurses need more education on machine learning and natural language processing, so they can lead and contribute to artificial intelligence developments in oncology. © 2024 The Authors","2-s2.0-85184067956"

EMS collects and monitors data from these sources and controls power flow through commands to ensure uninterrupted power supply, frequency and voltage maintenance, and power recovery in the event of a power outage. EMS works in a Distributed Network Protocol (DNP) 3.0-based network environment that is considered secure due to its unique security features and communication methods. However, cyberattacks exploiting the vulnerability of the DNP 3.0 protocol can manipulate the power generation output, resulting in serious consequences such as facility malfunction and power outages. To address this issue, this paper identifies security threats in power system networks, including DNP 3.0, and proposes an AI-based anomaly detection system based on DNP 3.0 network traffic. Existing network traffic target rule-based detection methods and signature-based detection methods have defects. We propose an AI-based anomaly detection system to compensate for defects in existing anomaly detection methods and perform efficient anomaly detection. To evaluate the performance of the AI-based anomaly detection system proposed in this paper, we used a dataset containing normal network traffic and nine types of attack network traffic obtained from the DNP 3.0 communication testbed, and experiments showed 99% accuracy, 98% TPR, and 1.6% FPR, resulting in 99% F-1 score. By implementing these security measures, power system network environments, including EMS, can be better protected against cyber threats. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","2-s2.0-85182608850"

Background: A care bundle is a set of core elements of care that are distilled from the most solid evidence-based practice guidelines and recommendations. Methods: The research questions were addressed in this bundle following the PICO criteria. The working group summarized the effects of interventions with the strength of recommendation and quality of evidence applying the GRADE methodology. ChatGPT AI system was used to independently assess the quality of evidence of each element in the bundle, together with the strength of the recommendations. Results: The 7 elements of the bundle discourage antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis, support the use of a full-solid diet in patients with mild to moderately severe acute biliary pancreatitis, and recommend early enteral nutrition in patients unable to feed by mouth. The bundle states that endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography should be performed within the first 48 to 72 hours of hospital admission in patients with cholangitis. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be performed in patients with mild acute biliary pancreatitis. When operative intervention is needed for necrotizing pancreatitis, this should start with the endoscopic step-up approach. Conclusions: We have developed a new care bundle with 7 key elements for managing patients with acute biliary pancreatitis. This new bundle, whose scientific strength has been increased thanks to the alliance between human knowledge and AI from the new ChatGPT software, should be introduced to emergency departments, wards, and intensive care units. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) systems, collaborative robots can solve problems that require a certain degree of intelligence not only in industry but also in the entertainment and educational fields. Board games like chess or checkers are a good example. When playing these games, a robotic system has to recognize the board and pieces and estimate their position in the robot reference frame, decide autonomously which is the best move to make (respecting the game rules), and physically execute it. In this paper, an intelligent and collaborative robotic system is presented to play Italian checkers. The system is able to acquire the game state using a camera, select the best move among all the possible ones through a decision-making algorithm, and physically manipulate the game pieces on the board, performing pick-and-place operations. Minimum-time trajectories are optimized online for each pick-and-place operation of the robot so as to make the game more fluent and interactive while meeting the kinematic constraints of the manipulator. The developed system is tested in a real-world setup using a Franka Emika arm with seven degrees of freedom.

On the other hand, discrimination of individuals is prohibited as a reflection of the principle of equality, in the constitutions of contemporary societies and in international laws regulating the fundamental rights of the individual. Within the framework of the mechanisms improved depending upon this principle and constitutional basis, a legal struggle is waged against discrimination of individuals as a person or as part of a community. However, discrimination has reached a different dimension in the digital environment with the developing technologies, especially AI systems. Such systems bring new problems and the anti-discrimination rules and mechanisms generated for the physical world cannot completely find a solution. The discrimination of AI systems could arise from reasons such as biased data sets and AI models, insufficient training data, and human-induced prejudices. At the same time, due to the black box problem in AI systems, the fact that it is not always clear which inputs lead to which result, and which inputs are another problem in the detection of discriminatory results. On the other side, problems caused by different applications such as credit scoring, exam grade determination, face recognition, and predictive policing, in which individuals face explicitly discrimination due to AI systems, are also emerging more and more. However, individuals do not always know that they deal with an AI system, and they may or may not be subject to discrimination. For instance, it has been revealed that the algorithm used in visa applications in the UK ranks the applications as red, green, and yellow, yet classifies a certain group as persons with suspicious nationality, and applications made by persons from this nationality receive higher risk scores and are more likely to be rejected. Even though the use of AI systems in our socio-economic life has reached an indispensable point, the prevention of discriminatory results caused by these systems also triggers the obligations of states in the context of fundamental rights. In this regard, the state has an obligation not to use discriminatory AI systems within the scope of its negative obligation; again, it has the obligation to ensure that private institutions or individuals cannot violate a fundamental right against other individuals in a way that is contrary to non-discrimination, within the scope of the positive obligation of the state. Furthermore, as in the process of protecting each fundamental right, the state will have an obligation to ensure that AI systems do not cause discrimination, and in case of discrimination, to eliminate the elements that cause it. In parallel with the development of AI technologies, it may be necessary to reinterpret existing rules and mechanisms or to establish new rules and mechanisms. In this sense, as in the draft Artificial Intelligence Act (“AIA”), having regard to the fact that AI has become a unique sector and its spheres of influence, organizing an institution specific to AI, and establishing an audit mechanism for developing and placing AI on the market, could be considered as an effective way to prevent and eliminate discrimination. In this regard, this Article aims to open a discussion about implementing newly emerging solutions to the Turkish legal framework, such as introducing a pre-audit mechanism as “AI—human rights impact assessment”, establishing AI audit mechanisms, and notification to individuals that they are subject to discrimination. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2024.","2-s2.0-85175160412"

Some initial reports claim outstanding accuracy followed by disappointing lack of confirmation, including our own early work on cervical screening. This is a presentation of lessons learned, organized as a conceptual step-by-step approach to bridge the gap between the creation of an AI algorithm and clinical efficacy. The first fundamental principle is specifying rigorously what the algorithm is designed to identify and what the test is intended to measure (eg, screening, diagnostic, or prognostic). Second, designing the AI algorithm to minimize the most clinically important errors. For example, many equivocal cervical images cannot yet be labeled because the borderline between cases and controls is blurred. To avoid a misclassified case-control dichotomy, we have isolated the equivocal cases and formally included an intermediate, indeterminate class (severity order of classes: case>indeterminate>control). The third principle is evaluating AI algorithms like any other test, using clinical epidemiologic criteria. Repeatability of the algorithm at the borderline, for indeterminate images, has proven extremely informative. Distinguishing between internal and external validation is also essential. Linking the AI algorithm results to clinical risk estimation is the fourth principle. Absolute risk (not relative) is the critical metric for translating a test result into clinical use. Finally, generating risk-based guidelines for clinical use that match local resources and priorities is the last principle in our approach. We are particularly interested in applications to lower-resource settings to address health disparities. We note that similar principles apply to other domains of AI-based image analysis for medical diagnostic testing. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.","2-s2.0-85174293935"

An artificial intelligence-based power reference correction (AI-PRC) module is developed for GFLIs to autonomously adjust their power setpoints during transient disturbances. A detailed analytical validation is provided that shows control rules in PEDG intrinsically follow the underlying dynamic of the swing-based machines to extend its stability boundary. Considering this fact, comprehensive transient and steady state-based mathematical models are used for constructing the learning database of the proposed AI-PRC. The proposed training approach can deal with grid's characteristics alterations and uncertainties. Thus, this approach incorporates PEDG's effective variables that shapes its dynamic response during transient disturbances. Subsequently, a neural network is trained by Bayesian regularization algorithm to realize the proposed AI-PRC scheme for frequency support via GFLIs. Several simulation and experimental case studies results validate the functionality of the proposed AI-PRC toward enhancing the PEDG's transient response and resiliency via GFLIs.

However, most of the modern AI techniques (e.g., Machine Learning – ML) have a black box nature, which hinder their adoption by practitioners in many application fields. This issue raises a recent emergence of a new research area in AI called Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), aiming at providing AI-based decision-making processes and outcomes to be easily understood, interpreted, and justified by humans. Since 2018, there has been an exponential growth of research studies on XAI, which has justified some review studies. However, these reviews currently focus on proposing taxonomies of XAI methods. Yet, XAI is by nature a highly applicative research field, and beyond XAI methods, it is also very important to investigate how XAI is concretely used in industries, and consequently derive the best practices to follow for better implementations and adoptions. There is a lack of studies on this latter point. To fill this research gap, we first propose a holistic review of business applications of XAI, by following the Theory, Context, Characteristics, and Methodology (TCCM) protocol. Based on the findings of this review, we secondly propose a methodological and theoretical framework in six steps that can be followed by all practitioners or stakeholders for improving the implementation and adoption of XAI in their business applications. We particularly highlight the need to rely on domain field and analytical theories to explain the whole analytical process, from the relevance of the business question to the robustness checking and the validation of explanations provided by XAI methods. Finally, we propose seven important future research avenues. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85177220628"

Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, named machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks, have shown great potential in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of NIDM. This paper proposes an AI-Enabled Network Intrusion Detection Model (AI-NIDM) called GWA-ANN for SG-CPS, which integrates AI techniques with traditional NIDS for improved detection and response to cyber-attacks. The proposed system is evaluated on a public SG-CPS dataset, and the results establish that AI-NIDM can effectively detect and classify various types of cyber-attacks with high accuracy and low false-positive rates.

Recently, neural-network-driven methods have attracted wide interest in developing non-uniform sampling to improve the sampling efficiency and reduce the calculation time. A region that contains an optimal path is predicted by neural networks and employed subsequently to biasedly generate samples. This work aims at enhancing the sampling efficiency and reducing the calculation time of the optimal path planning by a novel region and guideline prediction (denoted as RGP) model. We innovatively propose the RGP model with a guideline prediction module to estimate the guideline distributions, which are characterized by the central line of the predicted region. The predicted region and guideline are integrated into a sampling-based algorithm, namely RGP-RRT*, with an adaptively biased sampling strategy to select a proper domain for sampling. Simulations demonstrate the RGP model outperforms other region prediction models in accuracy and robustness. Besides, the RGP-RRT∗ reliably achieves a 7.2-80.1% reduction in calculation time and a 2.0-58.1% reduction in sample number compared with other neural-network-driven methods.  © 2016 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85182384296"

Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, the review delineates the literature landscape, unveiling unmanned vehicles, radars, wireless sensors, smartphones, and Wi-Fi as prominent modalities. Significant challenges include limited actual-physical world validation, on-site deployment logistics, reliance on communication infrastructure, and power consumption. Nevertheless, innovative strategies such as multi-sensory integration and on-site processing using TinyML, exhibit the potential to reduce these limitations, signifying promising opportunities for future research.

This scoping review maps out the existing literature on AI-based models for T2DM prediction, adhering to the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. A systematic search of longitudinal studies was conducted across four databases, including PubMed, Scopus, IEEE-Xplore, and Google Scholar. Forty studies that met our inclusion criteria were reviewed. Classical machine learning (ML) models dominated these studies, with electronic health records (EHR) being the predominant data modality, followed by multi-omics, while medical imaging was the least utilized. Most studies employed unimodal AI models, with only ten adopting multimodal approaches. Both unimodal and multimodal models showed promising results, with the latter being superior. Almost all studies performed internal validation, but only five conducted external validation. Most studies utilized the area under the curve (AUC) for discrimination measures. Notably, only five studies provided insights into the calibration of their models. Half of the studies used interpretability methods to identify key risk predictors revealed by their models. Although a minority highlighted novel risk predictors, the majority reported commonly known ones.

However, tourists need help bringing personal interest and high-value data from the plethora of tourism information. The rise of artificial intelligence has transformed traditional tourism into an intelligent, data-driven industry. This shift has generated vast tourism data, offering both opportunities and challenges. The paper discusses an AI and IoT-based Intelligent Tourism Recommendation System (ITRS) that offers travelers predefined itineraries, personalized suggestions, and tourism insights. This system simplifies attraction discovery, unveiling hidden value within tourism data at the intersection of AI and IoT. The present study thoroughly investigates AI-based recommendation algorithms before delving into the system’s architecture. It categorizes user-based, project-based, and article-based collaborative filtering methodologies tailored to specific goals. First, thoroughly examine AI-based recommendation algorithms before delving into the system architecture. Second, categorize collaborative filtering methods as user-based, project-based, and article-based, each tailored to specific objectives. Third, delve into the Apriori algorithm’s complexity within the context of weighted association rules and introduce an enhanced iteration for improved efficiency. The proposed scheme encompasses an elaborate ITRS plan featuring a user interest model and a client module, crucial for the computation and analysis of users’ long-term and short-term interests. Rigorous performance testing confirms the ITRS’s superiority across varying support levels, with experimental results demonstrating the Apriori algorithm’s exceptional accuracy, achieving a 94.3% improvement over other methods.

In this context, ethicality becomes a major concern to prevent AI systems from being biased, making mistakes, or going rogue. Requirements Engineering (RE) is the research area that can exert a great impact in the development of ethical systems by design. However, proposing concepts, tools and techniques that support the incorporation of ethicality into the software development processes as explicit requirements remains a great challenge in the RE field. In this paper, we rely on Ontology-based Requirements Engineering (ObRE) as a method to elicit and analyze ethicality requirements (‘Ethicality requirements’ is adopted as a name for the class of requirements studied in this paper by analogy to other quality requirements studied in software engineering, such as usability, reliability, and portability, etc. The use of this term (as opposed to ‘ethical requirements’) highlights that they represent requirements for ethical systems, analogous to how ‘trustworthiness requirements’ represent requirements for trustworthy systems. To put simply: the predicates ‘ethical’ or ‘trustworthy’ are not meant to be predicated over the requirements themselves). ObRE applies ontological analysis to ontologically unpack terms and notions that are referred to in requirements elicitation. Moreover, this method instantiates the adopted ontology and uses it to guide the requirements analysis activity. In a previous paper, we presented a solution concerning two ethical principles, namely Beneficence and Non-maleficence. The present paper extends the previous work by targeting two other important ethicality principles, those of Explicability and Autonomy. For each of these new principles, we do ontological unpacking of the relevant concepts, and we present requirements elicitation and analysis guidelines, as well as examples in the context of a driverless car case. Furthermore, we validate our approach by analysing the requirements elicitation made for the driverless car case in contrast with a similar case, and by assessing our method’s coverage w.r.t European Union guidelines for Trustworthy AI. © 2023, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85165614536"

In cardiovascular disease, and vascular surgery specifically, AI tools such as machine learning, natural language processing, and deep neural networks have been applied to automatically detect underdiagnosed diseases, such as peripheral artery disease, abdominal aortic aneurysms, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In addition to disease detection and risk stratification, AI has been used to identify guideline-concordant statin therapy use and reasons for nonuse, which has important implications for population-based cardiovascular disease health. Although many studies highlight the potential applications of AI, few address true clinical workflow implementation of available AI-based tools. Specific examples, such as determination of optimal statin treatment based on individual patient risk factors and enhancement of intraoperative fluoroscopy and ultrasound imaging, demonstrate the potential promise of AI integration into clinical workflow. Many challenges to AI implementation in health care remain, including data interoperability, model bias and generalizability, prospective evaluation, privacy and security, and regulation. Multidisciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration, as well as adopting a framework for integration, will be critical for the successful implementation of AI tools into clinical practice. © 2023","2-s2.0-85168592097"

This review aims to describe current evidence for continuous vital sign monitoring (CVSM) with AI-based alerts-from sensor technology, through alert reduction, impact on complications, and to user-experience during implementation.Recent findingsCVSM identifies significantly more vital sign deviations than manual intermittent monitoring. This results in high alert generation without AI-evaluation, both in patients with and without complications. Current AI is at the rule-based level, and this potentially reduces irrelevant alerts and identifies patients at need. AI-Aided CVSM identifies complications earlier with reduced staff workload and a potential reduction of severe complications.SummaryThe current evidence for AI-Aided CSVM suggest a significant role for the technology in reducing the constant 10-30% in-hospital risk of severe postoperative complications. However, large, randomized trials documenting the benefit for patient improvements are still sparse.

However, the review found that, in published work, the results showed promise. However, some significant limitations kept that technique from implementation in reality and being used for medical decisions; examples of such limitations are imbalanced and the absence of standardized dataset for evaluation, lack of interpretability of the model, inconsistency of performance while using a new dataset, security, and privacy of health data and lack of collaboration with physicians, etc. AI using ECG data accompanied by modern wearable biosensor technologies has the potential to allow for health monitoring and early diagnosis within reach of larger populations.

The efficiency of PV systems depends upon the reliable detection and diagnosis of faults. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques has been a growing trend in addressing these issues. The goal of this systematic review is to offer a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in AI-based methodologies for PV fault detection, consolidating the key findings from 31 research papers. An initial pool of 142 papers were identified, from which 31 were selected for in-depth review following the PRISMA guidelines. The title, objective, methods, and findings of each paper were analyzed, with a focus on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches. ML and DL are particularly suitable for PV fault detection because of their capacity to process and analyze large amounts of data to identify complex patterns and anomalies. This study identified several AI techniques used for fault detection in PV systems, ranging from classical ML methods like k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and random forest to more advanced deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Quantum circuits and infrared imagery were also explored as potential solutions. The analysis found that DL models, in general, outperformed traditional ML models in accuracy and efficiency. This study shows that AI methodologies have evolved and been increasingly applied in PV fault detection. The integration of AI in PV fault detection offers high accuracy and effectiveness. After reviewing these studies, we proposed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based method for PV fault detection and classification. © 2023 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85176330813"

In this paper, we propose a procedure for systematically collecting such pathological voices and developing AI-based automated tools to support differential diagnosis. Guidelines on the most appropriate recording devices, vocal tasks, and acoustical parameters are provided to simplify, speed up, and make the whole procedure homogeneous and reproducible. The proposed procedure was applied to a group of 56 subjects affected by Costello syndrome (CS), Down syndrome (DS), Noonan syndrome (NS), and Smith–Magenis syndrome (SMS). The entire database was divided into three groups: pediatric subjects (PS; individuals < 12 years of age), female adults (FA), and male adults (MA). In line with the literature results, the Kruskal–Wallis test and post hoc analysis with Dunn–Bonferroni test revealed several significant differences in the acoustical features not only between healthy subjects and patients but also between syndromes within the PS, FA, and MA groups. Machine learning provided a k-nearest-neighbor classifier with 86% accuracy for the PS group, a support vector machine (SVM) model with 77% accuracy for the FA group, and an SVM model with 84% accuracy for the MA group. These preliminary results suggest that the proposed method based on acoustical analysis and AI could be useful for an effective, non-invasive automatic characterization of genetic syndromes. In addition, clinicians could benefit in the case of genetic syndromes that are extremely rare or present multiple variants and facial phenotypes. © 2023 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85180449586"

University education needs to maintain its relevance in an AI-mediated world, but the higher education sector is only beginning to engage deeply with the implications of AI within society. We define AI according to a relational epistemology, where, in the context of a particular interaction, a computational artefact provides a judgement about an optimal course of action and that this judgement cannot be traced. Therefore, by definition, AI must always act as a ‘black box’. Rather than seeking to explain ‘black boxes’, we argue that a pedagogy for an AI-mediated world involves learning to work with opaque, partial and ambiguous situations, which reflect the entangled relationships between people and technologies. Such a pedagogy asks learners locate AI as socially bounded, where AI is always understood within the contexts of its use. We outline two particular approaches to achieve this: (a) orienting students to quality standards that surround AIs, what might be called the tacit and explicit ‘rules of the game’; and (b) providing meaningful interactions with AI systems. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Artificial intelligence (AI) is conceptualised in many different ways but is rarely defined in the higher education literature. Experts have outlined a range of graduate capabilities for working in a world of AI such as teamwork or ethical thinking. The higher education literature outlines an imperative need to respond to AI, as underlined by recent commentary on ChatGPT. What this paper adds A definition of an AI that is relational: A particular interaction where a computational artefact provides a judgement about an optimal course of action, which cannot be easily traced. Focusing on working with AI black boxes rather than trying to see inside the technology. Describing a pedagogy for an AI-mediated world that promotes working in complex situations with partial and indeterminate information. Implications for practice and/or policy Focusing on quality standards helps learners understand the social regulating boundaries around AI. Promoting learner interactions with AI as part of a sociotechnical ensemble helps build evaluative judgement in weighting AI's contribution to work. Asking learners to work with AI systems prompts understanding of the evaluative, ethical and practical necessities of working with a black box. © 2023 The Authors.

Identifying potential areas where AI can contribute to clinical practice, enables AI research to align with the needs of clinicians and ultimately patients. Design Qualitative interview study. Setting A national study conducted in the Netherlands between November 2022 and February 2023. Participants Dutch clinicians working in obstetrics with varying relevant work experience, gender and age. Analysis Thematic analysis of qualitative interview transcripts. Results Thirteen gynaecologists were interviewed about hypothetical scenarios of an implemented AI model. Thematic analysis identified two major themes: perceived usefulness and trust. Usefulness involved AI extending human brain capacity in complex pattern recognition and information processing, reducing contextual influence and saving time. Trust required validation, explainability and successful personal experience. This result shows two paradoxes: first, AI is expected to provide added value by surpassing human capabilities, yet also a need to understand the parameters and their influence on predictions for trust and adoption was expressed. Second, participants recognised the value of incorporating numerous parameters into a model, but they also believed that certain contextual factors should only be considered by humans, as it would be undesirable for AI models to use that information. Conclusions Obstetricians' opinions on the potential value of AI highlight the need for clinician-AI researcher collaboration. Trust can be built through conventional means like randomised controlled trials and guidelines. Holistic impact metrics, such as changes in workflow, not just clinical outcomes, should guide AI model development. Further research is needed for evaluating evolving AI systems beyond traditional validation methods.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

In our study, 250 global participants performed a standardized motor task involving finger-tapping in front of a webcam. To establish the severity of Parkinsonian symptoms based on the finger-tapping task, three expert neurologists independently rated the recorded videos on a scale of 0–4, following the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). The inter-rater reliability was excellent, with an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.88. We developed computer algorithms to obtain objective measurements that align with the MDS-UPDRS guideline and are strongly correlated with the neurologists’ ratings. Our machine learning model trained on these measures outperformed two MDS-UPDRS certified raters, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.58 points compared to the raters’ average MAE of 0.83 points. However, the model performed slightly worse than the expert neurologists (0.53 MAE). The methodology can be replicated for similar motor tasks, providing the possibility of evaluating individuals with PD and other movement disorders remotely, objectively, and in areas with limited access to neurological care. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","2-s2.0-85168699202"

AI has already come into extensive use in spacecraft operations, for example to support efficient operations of satellite constellations and system health management. However, since most critical infrastructures rely on space systems, the use of new technologies, such as AI algorithms or increased system autonomy on-board, introduces further vulnerabilities on the system level. As a matter of fact, AI cyber security is becoming an important aspect to ensure space safety and operational security. Apart from identifying new vulnerabilities that AI systems may introduce to space assets, this paper seeks for safety guidelines and technical standardisations developed for terrestrial applications that can be applicable to AI systems in space. Existing policy guidance for cybersecurity and AI, especially for the European context, is discussed. To promote the safe use of AI technologies in space this work underlines the urgency for policymakers, governance, and technical institutions to initiate or further support the development of a suitable framework to address the new cyber-vulnerabilities introduced by AI technologies when applied to space systems. The paper suggests a regulatory approach based on technical standardisation in the field of AI, which is built upon a multidisciplinary research of AI applications in non-space sectors where the level of autonomy is more advanced. © 2023 International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety","2-s2.0-85168485820"

With ChatGPT and other large generative models taking the technology to the next level, solutions are urgently needed. In a much-anticipated move, the European Commission advanced two proposals outlining the European approach to AI liability in September 2022: a novel AI Liability Directive (AILD) and a revision of the Product Liability Directive (PLD). They constitute the final cornerstone of AI regulation in the EU. Crucially, the liability proposals and the proposed EU AI Act are inherently intertwined: the latter does not contain any individual rights of affected persons, and the former lack specific, substantive rules on AI development and deployment. Taken together, these acts may well trigger a “Brussels effect” in AI regulation, with significant consequences for the US and other countries. Against this background, this paper makes three novel contributions. First, it examines in detail the liability proposals and shows that, while making steps in the right direction, they ultimately represent a half-hearted approach: if enacted as foreseen, AI liability in the EU will primarily rest on disclosure of evidence mechanisms and a set of narrowly defined presumptions concerning fault, defectiveness and causality. Hence, second, the article suggests amendments to the proposed AI liability framework. They are collected in a concise Annex at the end of the paper. I argue, inter alia, that the dichotomy between the fault-based AILD Proposal and the supposedly strict liability PLD Proposal is fictional and should be abandoned; that an EU framework for AI liability should comprise one fully harmonizing regulation instead of two insufficiently coordinated directives; and that the current proposals unjustifiably collapse fundamental distinctions between social and individual risk by equating high-risk AI systems in the AI Act with those under the liability framework. Third, based on an analysis of the key risks AI poses, the final part of the paper maps out a road for the future of AI liability and regulation, in the EU and beyond. More specifically, I make four key proposals. Effective compensation should be ensured by combining truly strict liability for certain high-risk AI systems with general presumptions of defectiveness, fault and causality in cases involving SMEs or non-high-risk AI systems. The paper introduces a novel distinction between illegitimate- and legitimate-harm models to delineate strict liability's scope. Truly strict liability should be reserved for high-risk AI systems that, from a social perspective, should not cause harm (illegitimate-harm models, e.g., autonomous vehicles or medical AI). Models meant to cause some unavoidable harm by ranking and rejecting individuals (legitimate-harm models, e.g., credit scoring or insurance scoring) may merely face rebuttable presumptions of defectiveness and causality. General-purpose AI systems and Foundation Models should only be subjected to high-risk regulation, including liability for high-risk AI systems, in specific high-risk use cases for which they are deployed. Consumers, in turn, ought to be liable based on regular fault, in general. Furthermore, innovation and legal certainty should be fostered through a comprehensive regime of safe harbours, defined quantitatively to the best extent possible. Moreover, trustworthy AI remains an important goal for AI regulation. Hence, the liability framework must specifically extend to non-discrimination cases and provide for clear rules concerning explainability (XAI). Finally, awareness for the climate effects of AI, and digital technology more broadly, is rapidly growing in computer science. In diametrical opposition to this shift in discourse and understanding, however, EU legislators have long neglected environmental sustainability in both the draft AI Act and the proposed liability regime. To counter this, I propose to jump-start sustainable AI regulation via sustainability impact assessments in the AI Act and sustainable design defects in the liability regime. In this way, the law may help spur not only fair AI and XAI, but also sustainable AI (SAI). © 2023 Philipp Hacker","2-s2.0-85170636566"

As we see, the basic problem of homogenization is the unreasonable dominance of the practical procedures over the theory. Therefore we try to formulate some questions of homogenization in accordance with the mathematical conventions. The topics to be discussed are as follows. (a) Themes and systems—meteorological, mathematical and software links. (b) Mathematical formulation of climate data series homogenization and special case of normal distribution. (c) Additive and multiplicative spatiotemporal models for climate data series homogenization. (d) Mathematical overview of methodological questions as, spatial comparison of series, inhomogeneity detection and adjustment of series, in accordance with the WMO Guidelines on Homogenisation (2020). (e) The last topic is the new version of MASH for homogenization of mean and standard deviation. The earlier versions of our method MASH (Multiple Analysis of Series for Homogenization; Szentimrey) were developed formerly at the Hungarian Meteorological Service. These procedures aimed to homogenize the daily and monthly data series in the mean, that is, the first order moment. The new version MASHv4.01 has been developed for joint homogenization of mean and standard deviation using some mathematical results. Theoretically, in case of normal distribution, the homogenization of mean and standard deviation is sufficient since if the first two moments are homogenous then the higher order moments are also homogeneous. An interactive automatic algorithm also was developed in this new version in order to make the homogenization easier for the users. We will present a summary of the software MASH where our intention was to develop a flexible, interactive automatic, artificial intelligence (AI) system.

Research suggests that up to 75% of surgical patients could have postponed an operation and managed with physical training. ERVIN.2 is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical support system that addresses this problem by enhancing patient involvement in decisions concerning surgical knee and hip replacement. However, the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of using such a system are scantily documented. Objective: The primary objective is to investigate whether the usual care is non-inferior to ERVIN.2 supported care. The second objective is to determine if ERVIN.2 enhances clinical decision support and whether ERVIN.2 supported care is cost-effective. Methods: This study used a single-centre, non-inferiority, randomised controlled in a two-arm parallel-group design. The study will be reported in compliance with CONSORT guidelines. The control group receives the usual care. As an add-on, the intervention group have access to baseline scores and predicted Oxford hip/knee scores and HRQoL for both the surgical and the non-surgical trajectory. A cost-utility analysis will be conducted alongside the trial using a hospital perspective, a 1-year time horizon and effects estimated using EQ-5D-3L. Results will be presented as cost per QALY gain. Discussion: This study will bring knowledge about whether ERVIN.2 enhances clinical decision support, clinical effects, and cost-effectiveness of the AI system.

Although design principles suggest methods to avoid CS, challenges remain as new demands and systems continue to penetrate the competitive market. The dilemma is whether to use VR technology by experiencing the ultimate virtual world using a head-mounted display (HMD) with possible CS triggers or to avoid the triggers by avoiding using VR. With the huge success and potential in the entertainment industry, it is very important to focus on the solutions to handling CS dilemmas. Therefore, the main observation for the developers is to have a guide around the set of established design principles aiming to broadly reduce CS. In this paper, we provide a method to apply artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and use machine learning (ML) algorithms including support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees (DTs) and K-nearest neighbours (KNNs) to predict CS outcomes. Based on our findings, we have observed that DT and SVM surpassed KNN in test accuracy. Additionally, DT exhibited better results than both SVM and KNN in train accuracy. By exploiting the power of ML, developers will be able to predict the potential occurrence of CS while developing VR projects to find ways to alleviate CS more effectively. © 2023, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85160645005"

Our aim was to explore otolaryngologists' perceptions of quantitative objective disease measures as enabled by AI-based analysis, and determine preferences for sinus CT interpretation. Methods: A multi-methods design was used. We administered a survey to American Rhinologic Society members and conducted semi-structured interviews with a purposeful sample of otolaryngologists and rhinologists from varying backgrounds, practice settings and locations during 2020–2021. Interview topics included sinus CT reports, familiarity with AI-based analysis, and potential requisites for its future implementation. Interviews were then coded for content analysis. Differences in survey responses were calculated using Chi-squared test. Results: 120 of 955 surveys were returned, and 19 otolaryngologists (8 rhinologists) were interviewed. Survey data revealed more trust in conventional radiologist reports, but that AI-based reports would be more systematic and comprehensive. Interviews expanded on these results. Interviewees believed that conventional sinus CT reports had limited utility due to inconsistent content. However, they described relying on them for reporting incidental extra-sinus findings. Reporting could be improved with standardization and more detailed anatomical analysis. Interviewees expressed interest in AI-derived analysis given potential for standardization, although they desired evidence of accuracy and reproducibility to gain trust in AI-based reports. Conclusions: Sinus CT interpretation has shortcomings in its current state. Standardization and objectivity could be aided with deep learning-enabled quantitative analysis, although clinicians desire thorough validation to gain trust in the technology prior to its implementation. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","2-s2.0-85160053747"

Methods: Nine electronic databases were searched from 2012 to 31 August 2022 including grey literature search and hand searching of references of included articles. Risk of bias was assessed by two independent reviewers using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). Test characteristics namely true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives were extracted from all included articles into a 2x2 table. Study-specific estimates of sensitivity and specificity were pooled using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model and displayed using a forest plot and HSROC curve. Results: 66 studies were included in the review. A total of 518,931 patients were included whose mean ages varied from 32.62 to 70 years old.

Several AI-tools have already been developed to aid care delivery in emergency medicine (EM). However, many EM tools appear to have been developed without a cross-disciplinary needs assessment, making it difficult to understand their broader importance to general-practice. Clinician surveys about AI tools have been conducted within other medical specialties to help guide future design. This study aims to understand the needs of Canadian EPs for the apt use of AI-based tools. Methods: A national cross-sectional, two-stage, mixed-method electronic survey of Canadian EPs was conducted from January-May 2022. The survey includes demographic and physician practice-pattern data, clinicians’ current use and perceptions of AI, and individual rankings of which EM work-activities most benefit from AI. Results: The primary outcome is a ranked list of high-priority AI-tools for EM that physicians want translated into general use within the next 10 years. When ranking specific AI examples, ‘automated charting/report generation’, ‘clinical prediction rules’ and ‘monitoring vitals with early-warning detection’ were the top items. When ranking by physician work-activities, ‘AI-tools for documentation’, ‘AI-tools for computer use’ and ‘AI-tools for triaging patients’ were the top items. For secondary outcomes, EPs indicated AI was ‘likely’ (43.1%) or ‘extremely likely’ (43.7%) to be able to complete the task of ‘documentation’ and indicated either ‘a-great-deal’ (32.8%) or ‘quite-a-bit’ (39.7%) of potential for AI in EM. Further, EPs were either ‘strongly’ (48.5%) or ‘somewhat’ (39.8%) interested in AI for EM. Conclusions: Physician input on the design of AI is essential to ensure the uptake of this technology. Translation of AI-tools to facilitate documentation is considered a high-priority, and respondents had high confidence that AI could facilitate this task. This study will guide future directions regarding the use of AI for EM and help direct efforts to address prevailing technology-translation barriers such as access to high-quality application-specific data and developing reporting guidelines for specific AI-applications. With a prioritized list of high-need AI applications, decision-makers can develop focused strategies to address these larger obstacles. © 2023, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85165626463"

Specifically, the potential for achieving autonomy (a higher cognitive concept than legacy automation systems) has garnered significant interest. Thus, many autonomous systems like self-driving cars, are in the research/ development phase. Despite its numerous advantages, the adoption of autonomous control for Nuclear Power Plants is deficient mainly due to stringent safety concerns. Especially, autonomous control for Small Modular Reactors is a desirous capability to accrue its full potential. This study proposes an AI-based model for autonomous control of IP-200 NPP, a Small Modular Reactor (SMR) under development. The model adopts a modular architecture for performing different functions of monitoring/ diagnosis, strategy formulation and assessment. Despite following knowledge-based rules, the network decisions are optimized through supervised learning and fine-tuned through reinforcement learning.

However, most existing approaches either neglect the dynamic traffic environment or adopt manually designed rules, which fails to efficiently find a high-quality routing strategy. In this paper, we present a novel artificial intelligence (AI) based framework for logistic systems. This framework can simulate the spatio-temporal traffic conditions to form a dynamic environment in a data-driven manner. Under such a simulated environment, it adopts deep reinforcement learning techniques to intelligently generate the optimized routing strategy. Meanwhile, we also design an interactive frontend to visualize the simulated environment and routing strategies, which help operators evaluate the task performance.

Although the clinical implications of AI in EHR systems have been extensively analyzed, its application in HIE as a crucial source of patient data is less explored. Addressing this gap, our systematic review delves into utilizing AI models in HIE, gauging their predictive prowess and potential limitations. Employing databases such as Scopus, CINAHL, Google Scholar, PubMed/Medline, and Web of Science and adhering to the PRISMA guidelines, we unearthed 1021 publications. Of these, 11 were shortlisted for the final analysis. A noticeable preference for machine learning models in prognosticating clinical results, notably in oncology and cardiac failures, was evident. The metrics displayed AUC values ranging between 61% and 99.91%. Sensitivity metrics spanned from 12% to 96.50%, specificity from 76.30% to 98.80%, positive predictive values varied from 83.70% to 94.10%, and negative predictive values between 94.10% and 99.10%. Despite variations in specific metrics, AI models drawing on HIE data unfailingly showcased commendable predictive proficiency in clinical verdicts, emphasizing the transformative potential of melding AI with HIE. However, variations in sensitivity highlight underlying challenges.

The proposed solution adopting AI in the core database shows that incorporating AI improves the query processing and the self-tuning of database systems. In traditional systems, self-tuning database systems are commonly addressed with heuristics to suggest the physical structures (e.g., creation of indexes and materialized views) that enable the fastest execution of queries. However, existing designer tools do not explain/justify how the system behaves and the reasoning behind tuning activities. Moreover, these tools do not keep the database administrator (DBA) in the loop of the optimization process to trust some of the automatic tuning decisions. To address this problem, we introduce a framework called Explain-Tun that enables to predict and explain self-tuning actions with transparent strategy from historical data using two explicit models, that is, decision tree and random forests. First, we propose AI-based DBMS to explain how to select physical structures and provide decision rules extracted by machine learning (ML) as a designed plug-gable component. Second, a goal-oriented model to keep DBA in the loop of the optimization process in order to manipulate ML models as CRUD entities. Finally, we evaluate our approach on three use cases, results show that bridging the DBA's experience and ML make sense in tuning database systems. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","2-s2.0-85152072289"

The aim of this work was to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-based decision-support system (DSS) for automated diagnosis of Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) using IVCM images. Methods: The automated workflow for the AI-based DSS was defined and implemented using deep learning models, image processing techniques, rule-based decisions, and valuable input from domain experts. The models were evaluated with 5-fold-cross validation on a dataset of 85 patients (47,734 IVCM images from healthy, AK, and other disease cases) collected at a single eye clinic in Sweden. The developed DSS was validated on an additional 26 patients (21,236 images). Results: Overall, the DSS uses as input raw unprocessed IVCM image data, success-fully separates artefacts from true images (93% accuracy), then classifies the remain-ing images by their corneal layer (90% accuracy). The DSS subsequently predicts if the cornea is healthy or diseased (95% model accuracy). In disease cases, the DSS detects images with AK signs with 84% accuracy, and further localizes the regions of diagnostic value with 76.5% accuracy. Conclusions: The proposed AI-based DSS can automatically and accurately prepro-cess IVCM images (separating artefacts and sorting images into corneal layers) which decreases screening time. The accuracy of AK detection using raw IVCM images must be further explored and improved. Translational Relevance: The proposed automated DSS for experienced specialists assists in diagnosing AK using IVCM images. © 2023 The Authors.","2-s2.0-85178009830"

Early detection is crucial for improved patient outcomes. Non-invasive skin imaging techniques allow for improved diagnostic accuracy; however, their use is often limited due to the need for skilled practitioners trained to interpret images in a standardized fashion. Recent innovations in artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques for skin lesion image interpretation show potential for the use of AI in the early detection of melanoma. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the current state of AI-based techniques used in combination with non-invasive diagnostic imaging modalities including reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and dermoscopy. We also aimed to determine whether the application of AI-based techniques can lead to improved diagnostic accuracy of melanoma. Methods: A systematic search was conducted via the Medline/PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases for eligible publications between 2018 and 2022. Screening methods adhered to the 2020 version of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Included studies utilized AI-based algorithms for melanoma detection and directly addressed the review objectives. Results: We retrieved 40 papers amongst the three databases. All studies directly comparing the performance of AI-based techniques with dermatologists reported the superior or equivalent performance of AI-based techniques in improving the detection of melanoma. In studies directly comparing algorithm performance on dermoscopy images to dermatologists, AI-based algorithms achieved a higher ROC (>80%) in the detection of melanoma. In these comparative studies using dermoscopic images, the mean algorithm sensitivity was 83.01% and the mean algorithm specificity was 85.58%. Studies evaluating machine learning in conjunction with OCT boasted accuracy of 95%, while studies evaluating RCM reported a mean accuracy rate of 82.72%. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the robust potential of AI-based techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes through the early identification of melanoma. Further studies are needed to assess the generalizability of these AI-based techniques across different populations and skin types, improve standardization in image processing, and further compare the performance of AI-based techniques with board-certified dermatologists to evaluate clinical applicability. © 2023 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85173905237"

It is a collection of various data manipulation techniques that allow ML practitioners to systematically improve the quality of the data used in an ML pipeline. However, data-centric AI approaches are not well documented. Researchers have conducted various experiments without a clear set of guidelines. This survey highlights six major data-centric AI aspects that researchers are already using to intentionally or unintentionally improve the quality of AI systems. These include big data quality assessment, data preprocessing, transfer learning, semi-supervised learning, machine ​learning ​operations (MLOps), and the effect of adding more data. In addition, it highlights recent data-centric techniques adopted by ML practitioners. We addressed how adding data might harm datasets and how HoloClean can be used to restore and clean them.

To address this, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based nutritionist program that uses advanced language and image recognition models was created. This program can identify ingredients from images of a patient's meal and offer nutritional guidance and dietary recommendations. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the competence of the models that support this program. METHODS: The potential of an AI nutritionist program for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was evaluated through a multistep process. First, a survey was conducted among patients with T2DM and endocrinologists to identify knowledge gaps in dietary practices. ChatGPT and GPT 4.0 were then tested through the Chinese Registered Dietitian Examination to assess their proficiency in providing evidence-based dietary advice. ChatGPT's responses to common questions about medical nutrition therapy were compared with expert responses by professional dietitians to evaluate its proficiency. The model's food recommendations were scrutinized for consistency with expert advice. A deep learning-based image recognition model was developed for food identification at the ingredient level, and its performance was compared with existing models. Finally, a user-friendly app was developed, integrating the capabilities of language and image recognition models to potentially improve care for patients with T2DM. RESULTS: Most patients (182/206, 88.4%) demanded more immediate and comprehensive nutritional management and education. Both ChatGPT and GPT 4.0 passed the Chinese Registered Dietitian examination. ChatGPT's food recommendations were mainly in line with best practices, except for certain foods like root vegetables and dry beans. Professional dietitians' reviews of ChatGPT's responses to common questions were largely positive, with 162 out of 168 providing favorable reviews. The multilabel image recognition model evaluation showed that the Dino V2 model achieved an average F1 score of 0.825, indicating high accuracy in recognizing ingredients. CONCLUSIONS: The model evaluations were promising. The AI-based nutritionist program is now ready for a supervised pilot study. ©Haonan Sun, Kai Zhang, Wei Lan, Qiufeng Gu, Guangxiang Jiang, Xue Yang, Wanli Qin, Dongran Han.

Currently, there are various tools designed to detect genomic variants, however, it has always been a challenge to decide which tool to use, especially when various major genome projects have chosen to use different tools. Thus far, most of the existing tools were mainly developed to work on short-read data (i.e., Illumina); however, other sequencing technologies (e.g. PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore) have recently shown that they can also be used for variant calling. In addition, with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI)-based variant calling tools, there is a pressing need to compare these tools in terms of efficiency, accuracy, computational power, and ease of use. Results: In this study, we evaluated five of the most widely used conventional and AI-based variant calling tools (BCFTools, GATK4, Platypus, DNAscope, and DeepVariant) in terms of accuracy and computational cost using both short-read and long-read data derived from three different sequencing technologies (Illumina, PacBio HiFi, and ONT) for the same set of samples from the Genome In A Bottle project. The analysis showed that AI-based variant calling tools supersede conventional ones for calling SNVs and INDELs using both long and short reads in most aspects. In addition, we demonstrate the advantages and drawbacks of each tool while ranking them in each aspect of these comparisons. Conclusion: This study provides best practices for variant calling using AI-based and conventional variant callers with different types of sequencing data. © 2023, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85179581544"

An increasing number of AI-based applications have been developed, among which conversational AI has emerged. Regarding the latter, ChatGPT has risen to the headlines, scientific and otherwise, for its distinct propensity to simulate a ‘real’ discussion with its interlocutor, based on appropriate prompts. Although several clinical studies using ChatGPT have already been published in the literature, very little has yet been written about its potential application in human pathology. We conduct a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, using PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science (WoS) as databases, with the following keywords: ChatGPT OR Chat GPT, in combination with each of the following: pathology, diagnostic pathology, anatomic pathology, before 31 July 2023. A total of 103 records were initially identified in the literature search, of which 19 were duplicates. After screening for eligibility and inclusion criteria, only five publications were ultimately included. The majority of publications were original articles (n = 2), followed by a case report (n = 1), letter to the editor (n = 1) and review (n = 1). Furthermore, we performed a ‘query session’ with ChatGPT regarding pathologies such as pigmented skin lesions, malignant melanoma and variants, Gleason’s score of prostate adenocarcinoma, differential diagnosis between germ cell tumors and high grade serous carcinoma of the ovary, pleural mesothelioma and pediatric diffuse midline glioma. Although the premises are exciting and ChatGPT is able to co-advise the pathologist in providing large amounts of scientific data for use in routine microscopic diagnostic practice, there are many limitations (such as data of training, amount of data available, ‘hallucination’ phenomena) that need to be addressed and resolved, with the caveat that an AI-driven system should always provide support and never a decision-making motive during the histopathological diagnostic process. © 2023 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85179844098"

We aimed to develop a novel artificial intelligence (AI) system using whole slide images (WSIs) to predict LNM. Methods: We conducted a retrospective single center study. To train and test the AI model, we included LNM status-confirmed T1 and T2 CRC between April 2001 and October 2021. These lesions were divided into two cohorts: training (T1 and T2) and testing (T1). WSIs were cropped into small patches and clustered by unsupervised K-means. The percentage of patches belonging to each cluster was calculated from each WSI. Each cluster's percentage, sex, and tumor location were extracted and learned using the random forest algorithm. We calculated the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) to identify the LNM and the rate of over-surgery of the AI model and the guidelines. Results: The training cohort contained 217 T1 and 268 T2 CRCs, while 100 T1 cases (LNM-positivity 15%) were the test cohort. The AUC of the AI system for the test cohort was 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58–0.86), and 0.52 (95% CI 0.50–0.55) using the guidelines criteria (P = 0.0028). This AI model could reduce the 21% of over-surgery compared to the guidelines. Conclusion: We developed a pathologist-independent predictive model for LNM in T1 CRC using WSI for determination of the need for surgery after endoscopic resection.

AI-based models have shown promise in classifying tumor resectability, but reliability concerns have impeded clinical implementation. We propose extending the AI-based VasQNet model for classifying tumor resectability on AI-generated segmentations of computed tomography scans (CTs) to improve the models’ reliability. This extension allows VasQNet to defer decisions when the AI-generated segmentations violate pre-established rules on vascular anatomy, tumor location, and tumor size. We conducted experiments using CTs of (borderline) resectable and non-resectable PDAC patients. We evaluated the performance of the baseline VasQNet and the extended VasQNet with rule-based decision deferral (RBDD) by comparing their classifications to a ground-truth provided by a radiologist, employing agreement as a metric. Our results demonstrate that the extended VasQNet achieved a significantly higher agreement (90%) with the radiologist’s classification than the baseline VasQNet (67%). Notably, 17/31 (54%) deferred decisions would have been incorrect had they not been deferred. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of RBDD in improving the reliability of clinical diagnostic models through the exemplification of VasQNet. In conclusion, RBDD can enhance the reliability of clinical diagnostics models, facilitating integration into clinical practice.

Nevertheless, the use of these applications in sensitive clinical domains where high-stakes decisions are involved could be much more extensive if patients, medical professionals, and regulators were provided with mechanisms for trusting the results provided by AI systems. A key issue for achieving this is endowing AI systems with key dimensions of Trustworthy AI (TAI), such as fairness, transparency, robustness, or accountability, which are not usually considered within this context in a generalized and systematic manner. This paper reviews the recent advances in the TAI domain, including TAI standards and guidelines. We propose several requirements to be addressed in the design, development, and deployment of TAI systems and present a novel machine learning pipeline that contains TAI requirements as embedded components. Moreover, as an example of how current AI systems in medicine consider the TAI perspective, the study extensively reviews the recent literature (2017–2021) on AI systems in a prevalent and high social-impact disease: diagnosis and progression detection of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The most relevant AI systems in the AD domain are compared and discussed (such as machine learning, deep learning, ensembles, time series, and multimodal multitask) from the perspective of how they address TAI in their design. Several open challenges are highlighted, which could be claimed as one of the main reasons to justify the rare application of AI systems in real clinical environments. The study provides a roadmap to measure the TAI status of an AI systems and highlights its limitations. In addition, it provides the main guidelines to overcome these limitations and build medically trusted AI-based applications in the medical domain. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","2-s2.0-85150219301"

This can result in delayed, prolonged or false diagnoses. To accelerate and improve the diagnosis of diseases, clinical decision support systems would appear to be an appropriate tool. The objective of the project ‘Smart physician portal for patients with unclear disease’ (SATURN) is to employ a user-centered design process based on the requirements analysis presented in this paper to develop an artificial Intelligence (AI)-based diagnosis support system that specifically addresses the needs of German GPs. Methods: Requirements analysis for a GP-specific diagnosis support system was conducted in an iterative process with five GPs. First, interviews were conducted to analyze current workflows and the use of digital applications in cases of diagnostic uncertainty (as-is situation). Second, we focused on collecting and prioritizing tasks to be performed by an ideal smart physician portal (to-be situation) in a workshop. We then developed a task model with corresponding user requirements. Results: Numerous GP-specific user requirements were identified concerning the tasks and subtasks: performing data entry (open system, enter patient data), reviewing results (receiving and evaluating results), discussing results (with patients and colleagues), scheduling further diagnostic procedures, referring to specialists (select, contact, make appointments), and case closure. Suggested features particularly concerned the process of screening and assessing results: e.g., the system should focus more on atypical patterns of common diseases than on rare diseases only, display probabilities of differential diagnoses, ensure sources and results are transparent, and mark diagnoses that have already been ruled out. Moreover, establishing a means of using the platform to communicate with colleagues and transferring patient data directly from electronic patient records to the system was strongly recommended. Conclusions: Essential user requirements to be considered in the development and design of a diagnosis system for primary care could be derived from the analysis. They form the basis for mockup-development and system engineering. © 2023, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85166251260"

In this study, students’ teamwork skills were assessed independently by a computer algorithm and two human experts based on the transcripts of their conversations with “teammates” (chatbots). The relative accuracy of these assessments was evaluated against peer- and self-evaluations of teamwork. The assessment scores generated by the algorithm and human experts were highly correlated with each other and were comparable in their ability to predict teamwork. The scores generated by the algorithm were slightly more correlated with peer-evaluations than those generated by human experts (r =.25 and r =.17, respectively; p =.21).

Therefore, the investigation and development of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have become a key topic to address this challenge. For this reason, a comprehensive literature review about explanation methodologies for AI based models, focused in the field of drug discovery, is provided. In particular, an intuitive overview about each family of XAI approaches, such as those based on feature attribution, graph topologies, or counterfactual reasoning, oriented to a wide audience without a strong background in the AI discipline is introduced. As the main contribution, we propose a new taxonomy of the current XAI methods, which take into account specific issues related with the typical representations and computational problems study in the design of molecules. Additionally, we also present the main visualization strategies designed for supporting XAI approaches in the chemical domain. We conclude with key ideas about each method category, thoroughly providing insightful analysis about the guidelines and potential benefits of their adoption in medical chemistry.

Most SOCs are designed as a centralized mode which serves for single organization. The single-organisation SOCs face structural challenges in addressing operational security scenarios where the incidents span muliple organisations, and where these organsiations habitually deliver services in a synergistic way. In this paper, we propose the distributed security operation center (DSOC) that provides the distributed working mechanism for multiple organizations over the wide area network by combining their security probes. The security probes of DSOC are deployed in the different organizations to collect data and the collected data is transferred over wide area network to the data analysis center of the DSOC. Especially, the data communication between security probes and data analysis center is encrypted to ensure the data security of every organization. The data analysis center adopts rule-based, AI-based and threat intelligence-based algorithms to detect cyber-attacks. The detection results are input into the automated response module in the DSOC. The automated response module is the client-server structure and the client are installed in the security probe. The server of the automated response sends commands across the wide area network to the target client of the security probe to block the attackers quickly, and meanwhile the communication between client and server in the response processes is encrypted. In addition, the threat intelligence component of DSOC can aggregation intelligence from the organizations and easily share this intelligence with all organizations based on the distributed security probes. The DSOC also builds the security situational awareness system that visualizes the cyber threats of every organization and set the permission to view the security situation by using access control for every organization. The DSOC has been applied to institute of high energy physics (IHEP) and deployed in several collaborative large scientific facilities and scientific data centers since 2021. The security protections are persistently provided to all organizations within the DSOC framework. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons.","2-s2.0-85178636496"

As AI systems mediate more of our digital interactions, it is important to understand the degree to which AI systems might manipulate humans without the intent of the system designers. Our work clarifies challenges in defining and measuring this kind of manipulation from AI systems. Firstly, we build upon prior literature on manipulation and characterize the space of possible notions of manipulation, which we find to depend upon the concepts of incentives, intent, covertness, and harm. We review proposals on how to operationalize each concept and we outline challenges in including each concept in a definition of manipulation. Second, we discuss the connections between manipulation and related concepts, such as deception and coercion. We then analyze how our characterization of manipulation applies to recommender systems and language models, and give a brief overview of the regulation of manipulation in other domains. While some progress has been made in defining and measuring manipulation from AI systems, many gaps remain. In the absence of a consensus definition and reliable tools for measurement, we cannot rule out the possibility that AI systems learn to manipulate humans without the intent of the system designers. Manipulation could pose a significant threat to human autonomy and precautionary actions to mitigate it are likely warranted. © 2023 Owner/Author.","2-s2.0-85177860828"

Guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology recommended lipoprotein apheresis (LA) as the last-resort therapy for severe cases of familial hypercholesterolemia. However, LA devices equipped with a blood leak detector (BLD) sensor often generate false alarms due to turbidity caused by serum lipoproteins. This letter presents a protocol for creating hyperlipemic plasma samples and proposes the use of a microspectrometer-based BLD sensor to collect the spectra. Furthermore, to address the false alarm problem (blood rate 0.7%), we developed a first approach using thresholding and linear support vector machine (SVM). In addition, to improve data classification performance, three artificial neural networks (ANNs) were developed with different classification tasks, then applied to four different databases. ANNs aim to solve the problem of false alarms and accurately classify samples based on blood and phospholipids concentration, achieving 99% accuracy for data classification based on the combination of phospholipids and blood percentage.  © 2017 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85173036313"

We introduce an Adversarial CoevoluTION (ACTION) framework, which showcases AI's capacity to evolve adaptable policies capable of responding to dynamic changes and adversarial actions in HADR wargame scenarios. The framework presented employs a grammar-based genetic programming algorithm to evolve intelligent and interpretable player policies. We apply the ACTION framework to a HADR wargame case study, commonly used by the Australian Defence Science and Technology Group for research purposes. The case study centres on a hypothetical disaster relief scenario in the fictional Joadia Islands, struck by a tsunami, necessitating the evacuation of dispersed civilians. Experimental results illustrate that the ACTION framework can evolve policies that adapt to environmental uncertainties and respond effectively to adversarial actions.

Among the available focal treatment methods for PCa, cryoablation offers several technical advantages, including the visibility of the boundaries of frozen tissue on the intraprocedural images, access to anterior lesions, and the proven ability to treat postradiation recurrence. However, predicting the final volume of the frozen tissue is challenging as it depends on several patient-specific factors, such as proximity to heat sources and thermal properties of the prostatic tissue. Materials and Methods: This paper presents a convolutional neural network model based on 3D-Unet to predict the frozen isotherm boundaries (iceball) resultant from a given a cryo-needle placement. Intraprocedural magnetic resonance images acquired during 38 cases of focal cryoablation of PCa were retrospectively used to train and validate the model. The model accuracy was assessed and compared against a vendor-provided geometrical model, which is used as a guideline in routine procedures. Results: The mean Dice Similarity Coefficient using the proposed model was 0.79 ± 0.08 (mean + SD) vs 0.72 ± 0.06 using the geometrical model (P < .001). Conclusion: The model provided an accurate iceball boundary prediction in less than 0.4 second and has proven its feasibility to be implemented in an intraprocedural planning algorithm. © 2023 The Association of University Radiologists","2-s2.0-85160220389"

Existing clinical risk scores are inadequate in predicting cardiac events, and conventional risk factors alone do not accurately classify many individuals at risk. Several CVD biomarkers consider the multiple pathways involved in the development of atherosclerosis, which is the primary cause of CVD/Stroke in RA. To enhance the accuracy of CVD/Stroke risk assessment in the RA framework, a proposed approach involves combining genomic-based biomarkers (GBBM) derived from plasma and/or serum samples with innovative non-invasive radiomic-based biomarkers (RBBM), such as measurements of synovial fluid, plaque area, and plaque burden. This review presents two hypotheses: (i) RBBM and GBBM biomarkers exhibit a significant correlation and can precisely detect the severity of CVD/Stroke in RA patients. (ii) Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based preventive, precision, and personalized (aiP3) CVD/Stroke risk AtheroEdge™ model (AtheroPoint™, CA, USA) that utilizes deep learning (DL) to accurately classify the risk of CVD/stroke in RA framework. The authors conducted a comprehensive search using the PRISMA technique, identifying 153 studies that assessed the features/biomarkers of RBBM and GBBM for CVD/Stroke. The study demonstrates how DL models can be integrated into the AtheroEdge™–aiP3 framework to determine the risk of CVD/Stroke in RA patients. The findings of this review suggest that the combination of RBBM with GBBM introduces a new dimension to the assessment of CVD/Stroke risk in the RA framework. Synovial fluid levels that are higher than normal lead to an increase in the plaque burden. Additionally, the review provides recommendations for novel, unbiased, and pruned DL algorithms that can predict CVD/Stroke risk within a RA framework that is preventive, precise, and personalized. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85169157808"

Nevertheless, a challenge to its effectiveness arises from the data imbalance, where certain entities are common while others are scarce. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel text generation approach that harnesses Zipf's law, which is a powerful tool from informetrics for studying human language. By employing characteristics of Zipf's law, words within the documents are classified as common and rare ones. Subsequently, sentences are classified into common and rare ones, and are further processed by text generation models accordingly. Rare entities within the generated sentences are then labeled using human-designed rules, serving as a supplement to the raw dataset, thereby mitigating the imbalance problem. The study presents a case of extracting entities from technical documents, and the extensive experimental results on two datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, the significance and potential of Zipf's law in driving the progress of artificial intelligence (AI) is discussed, broadening the scope and coverage of informetrics.

The ‘AI Liability Directive’ contains rules on the disclosure of information and the alleviation of the burden of proof in relation to damage caused by AI systems. The ‘revised Product Liability Directive’ substantially modifies the current product liability regime by broadening the scope, integrating new circumstances to assess the product's defectiveness and introducing provisions regarding presumptions of defectiveness and causation. In this article, we evaluate how both proposals provide some answers to major technological developments – in particular AI – in view of the issues they raise as identified in the legal literature. To do so, we also provide a clear understanding of the major provisions in both proposals, supported by visuals. Although we welcome both proposals for several reasons outlined in the article, different unclarities and inconsistencies need to be resolved. These inter alia relate to the unclarity of terms, the position of claimants, the uncertain interaction with other supranational initiatives and the many interpretation issues with regard to the fault-based liability regime. A more fundamental objection relates to the choice of the revised Product Liability Directive to capture all liability issues with AI systems, which comes at the cost of losing the connection to ‘product’ as a grounding concept. Our findings can be used by policymakers in further adapting and refining both proposals to the digital reality. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85174727865"

Despite notable efforts in the development of digital solutions for sign language recognition (SLR), several issues persist, such as cross-platform interoperability and strategies for tokenizing signs to enable continuous conversations and coherent sentence construction. To address such issues, this paper proposes a non-invasive Portuguese Sign Language (Língua Gestual Portuguesa or LGP) interpretation system-as-a-service, leveraging skeletal posture sequence inference powered by long-short term memory (LSTM) architectures. To address the scarcity of examples during machine learning (ML) model training, dataset augmentation strategies are explored. Additionally, a buffer-based interaction technique is introduced to facilitate LGP terms tokenization. This technique provides real-time feedback to users, allowing them to gauge the time remaining to complete a sign, which aids in the construction of grammatically coherent sentences based on inferred terms/words. To support human-like conditioning rules for interpretation, a large language model (LLM) service is integrated. Experiments reveal that LSTM-based neural networks, trained with 50 LGP terms and subjected to data augmentation, achieved accuracy levels ranging from 80% to 95.6%. Users unanimously reported a high level of intuition when using the buffer-based interaction strategy for terms/words tokenization. Furthermore, tests with an LLM—specifically ChatGPT—demonstrated promising semantic correlation rates in generated sentences, comparable to expected sentences. © 2023 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85178285214"

Current guidelines recommend that IBS is diagnosed using the symptom-based Rome IV criteria. Despite this, when patients seek medical attention, they are usually over-investigated. This issue might be resolved by novel technologies in medicine, such as the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this context, this paper aims to review AI applications in IBS. AI in colonoscopy proved to be useful in organic lesion detection and diagnosis and in objectively assessing the quality of the procedure. Only a recently published study talked about the potential of AI-colonoscopy in IBS. AI was also used to study biofilm characteristics in the large bowel and establish a potential relationship with IBS. Moreover, an AI algorithm was developed in order to correlate specific bowel sounds with IBS. In addition to that, AI-based smartphone applications have been developed to facilitate the monitoring of IBS symptoms. From a therapeutic standpoint, an AI system was created to recommend specific diets based on an individual’s microbiota. In conclusion, future IBS diagnosis and treatment may benefit from AI. © 2023 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85176319405"

Background: Misdiagnosis of headache disorders is a serious issue and AI-based headache diagnosis models are scarce. Methods: We developed an AI-based headache diagnosis model and conducted internal validation based on a retrospective investigation of 6058 patients (4240 training dataset for model development and 1818 test dataset for internal validation) diagnosed by a headache specialist. The ground truth was the diagnosis by the headache specialist. The diagnostic performance of the AI model was evaluated. Results: The dataset included 4829/6058 (79.7%) patients with migraine, 834/6058 (13.8%) with tension-type headache, 78/6058 (1.3%) with trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, 38/6058 (0.6%) with other primary headache disorders, and 279/6058 (4.6%) with other headaches. The mean (standard deviation) age was 34.7 (14.5) years, and 3986/6058 (65.8%) were female. The model's micro-average accuracy, sensitivity (recall), specificity, precision, and F-values for the test dataset were 93.7%, 84.2%, 84.2%, 96.1%, and 84.2%, respectively. The diagnostic performance for migraine was high, with a sensitivity of 88.8% and c-statistics of 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.87–0.91). Conclusions: Our AI model demonstrated high diagnostic performance for migraine. If secondary headaches can be ruled out, the model can be a powerful tool for diagnosing migraine; however, further data collection and external validation are required to strengthen the performance, ensure the generalizability in other outpatients, and demonstrate its utility in real-world settings. © 2023 American Headache Society.","2-s2.0-85168590141"

Early screening and accurate diagnosis are crucial for improving prognosis. Radiographic imaging modalities such as digital mammography (DM), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), and nuclear medicine techniques, are commonly used for breast cancer assessment. And histopathology (HP) serves as the gold standard for confirming malignancy. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies show great potential for quantitative representation of medical images to effectively assist in segmentation, diagnosis, and prognosis of breast cancer. In this review, we overview the recent advancements of AI technologies for breast cancer, including 1) improving image quality by data augmentation, 2) fast detection and segmentation of breast lesions and diagnosis of malignancy, 3) biological characterization of the cancer such as staging and subtyping by AI-based classification technologies, 4) prediction of clinical outcomes such as metastasis, treatment response, and survival by integrating multi-omics data. Then, we then summarize large-scale databases available to help train robust, generalizable, and reproducible deep learning models. Furthermore, we conclude the challenges faced by AI in real-world applications, including data curating, model interpretability, and practice regulations. Besides, we expect that clinical implementation of AI will provide important guidance for the patient-tailored management. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85172011893"

The goal was to develop a workflow for performance evaluation of three commercial auto-segmentation tools to select one candidate for clinical implementation. Materials and Methods: One hundred patients with six treatment sites (brain, head-and-neck, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis) were included. Three sets of AI-based contours for organs-at-risk (OAR) generated by three software tools and manually drawn expert contours were blindly rated for contouring accuracy. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC), the Hausdorff distance, and a dose/volume evaluation based on the recalculation of the original treatment plan were assessed. Statistically significant differences were tested using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the post-hoc Dunn Test with Bonferroni correction. Results: The mean DSC scores compared to expert contours for all OARs combined were 0.80 ± 0.10, 0.75 ± 0.10, and 0.74 ± 0.11 for the three software tools. Physicians' rating identified equivalent or superior performance of some AI-based contours in head (eye, lens, optic nerve, brain, chiasm), thorax (e.g., heart and lungs), and pelvis and abdomen (e.g., kidney, femoral head) compared to manual contours. For some OARs, the AI models provided results requiring only minor corrections. Bowel-bag and stomach were not fit for direct use. During the interdisciplinary discussion, the physicians' rating was considered the most relevant. Conclusion: A comprehensive method for evaluation and clinical implementation of commercially available auto-segmentation software was developed. The in-depth analysis yielded clear instructions for clinical use within the radiotherapy department. © 2023 The Author(s)","2-s2.0-85178100756"

Automated software testing of this software system is inevitable; however, currently, it is limited in CRN's practice. To this end, we present an industrial case study to evaluate an AI-based system-level testing tool, i.e., EvoMaster, in terms of its effectiveness in testing CRN's software system. In particular, we focus on GURI, CRN's medical rule engine, which is a key component at the CRN. We test GURI with EvoMaster's black-box and white-box tools and study their test effectiveness regarding code coverage, errors found, and domain-specific rule coverage. The results show that all EvoMaster tools achieve a similar code coverage; i.e., around 19% line, 13% branch, and 20% method; and find a similar number of errors; i.e., 1 in GURI's code. Concerning domain-specific coverage, EvoMaster's black-box tool is the most effective in generating tests that lead to applied rules; i.e., 100% of the aggregation rules and between 12.86% and 25.81% of the validation rules; and to diverse rule execution results; i.e., 86.84% to 89.95% of the aggregation rules and 0.93% to 1.72% of the validation rules pass, and 1.70% to 3.12% of the aggregation rules and 1.58% to 3.74% of the validation rules fail. We further observe that the results are consistent across 10 versions of the rules. Based on these results, we recommend using EvoMaster's black-box tool to test GURI since it provides good results and advances the current state of practice at the CRN. Nonetheless, EvoMaster needs to be extended to employ domain-specific optimization objectives to improve test effectiveness further. Finally, we conclude with lessons learned and potential research directions, which we believe are applicable in a general context. © 2023 ACM.","2-s2.0-85172431647"

However, several methodological challenges exist that may limit the insights we can obtain from high-dimensional data and our ability to translate these findings into improved patient outcomes. To improve reproducibility and replicability, researchers should make their well-documented code and modeling pipelines openly available. Data should also be shared where appropriate. To enhance the acceptability of models and AI-enabled systems to users, researchers should prioritize interpretable methods that provide insights into how decisions are generated. Models should be developed using multiple, diverse datasets to improve robustness, generalizability, and reduce potentially harmful bias. To improve clarity and reproducibility, researchers should adhere to reporting guidelines that are co-produced with multiple stakeholders. If these methodological challenges are overcome, AI and ML hold enormous promise for changing the landscape of dementia research and care. Highlights: Machine learning (ML) can improve diagnosis, prevention, and management of dementia. Inadequate reporting of ML procedures affects reproduction/replication of results. ML models built on unrepresentative datasets do not generalize to new datasets. Obligatory metrics for certain model structures and use cases have not been defined.

High-quality research articles are important for the development of good CPGs. Commonly used manual screening processes are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques have been widely used to analyze unstructured data, including texts and images. Currently, there are no effective/efficient AI-based systems for screening literature. Therefore, developing an effective method for automatic literature screening can provide significant advantages. Methods: Using advanced AI techniques, we propose the Paper title, Abstract, and Journal (PAJO) model, which treats article screening as a classification problem. For training, articles appearing in the current CPGs are treated as positive samples. The others are treated as negative samples. Then, the features of the texts (e.g., titles and abstracts) and journal characteristics are fully utilized by the PAJO model using the pretrained bidirectional-encoder-representations-from-transformers (BERT) model. The resulting text and journal encoders, along with the attention mechanism, are integrated in the PAJO model to complete the task. Results: We collected 89,940 articles from PubMed to construct a dataset related to neck pain. Extensive experiments show that the PAJO model surpasses the state-of-the-art baseline by 1.91% (F1 score) and 2.25% (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). Its prediction performance was also evaluated with respect to subject-matter experts, proving that PAJO can successfully screen high-quality articles. Conclusions: The PAJO model provides an effective solution for automatic literature screening. It can screen high-quality articles on neck pain and significantly improve the efficiency of CPG development. The methodology of PAJO can also be easily extended to other diseases for literature screening. © 2023, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85175729816"

Thus, now it is very important to exploit them for the enhanced reliability, efficiency, and consistency of the RTP-producing culture processes and for the reduced incipient or abrupt faults. It is achievable by AI-based data-driven models (DDMs), which allow us to correlate biological and process conditions and cell culture states. In this work, we provide practical guidelines for choosing the best combination of model elements to design and implement successful DDMs for given hypothetical in-line data sets during mAb-producing Chinese hamster ovary cell culture, as such enabling us to forecast dynamic behaviors of culture performance such as viable cell density, mAb titer as well as glucose, lactate and ammonia concentrations. To do so, we created DDMs that balance computational load with model accuracy and reliability by identifying the best combination of multistep ahead forecasting strategies, input features, and AI algorithms, which is potentially applicable to implementation of interactive DDM within bioprocess digital twins.

We report a novel strategy that automates the detection of hidden cardiovascular diseases, such as LVSD, adapted for noisy single-lead ECGs obtained on wearable and portable devices. We use 385,601 ECGs for development of a standard and noise-adapted model. For the noise-adapted model, ECGs are augmented during training with random gaussian noise within four distinct frequency ranges, each emulating real-world noise sources. Both models perform comparably on standard ECGs with an AUROC of 0.90. The noise-adapted model performs significantly better on the same test set augmented with four distinct real-world noise recordings at multiple signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), including noise isolated from a portable device ECG. The standard and noise-adapted models have an AUROC of 0.72 and 0.87, respectively, when evaluated on ECGs augmented with portable ECG device noise at an SNR of 0.5.

Various guidelines, principles, and regulatory frameworks are designed to ensure that AI technologies adhere to ethical well-being. However, the implications of AI ethics principles and guidelines are still being debated. To further explore the significance of AI ethics principles and relevant challenges, we conducted a survey of 99 randomly selected representative AI practitioners and lawmakers (e.g., AI engineers and lawyers) from 20 countries across five continents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study that unveils the perceptions of two different types of population (AI practitioners and lawmakers) and the study findings confirm that transparency, accountability, and privacy are the most critical AI ethics principles. On the other hand, lack of ethical knowledge, no legal frameworks, and lacking monitoring bodies are found to be the most common AI ethics challenges. The impact analysis of the challenges across principles reveals that conflict in practice is a highly severe challenge. Moreover, the perceptions of practitioners and lawmakers are statistically correlated with significant differences for particular principles (e.g. fairness and freedom) and challenges (e.g. lacking monitoring bodies and machine distortion). Our findings stimulate further research, particularly empowering existing capability maturity models to support ethics-aware AI systems' development and quality assessment.  © 2014 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85149866419"

Traditional security approaches such as signature-based and rule-based have limited detection capabilities toward new and sophisticated attacks. To address this issue, there has been an increasing focus on implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in cloud security measures. In this research article, we present CADS-ML/DL, an efficient cloud-based multi-attack detection system. We investigate the effectiveness of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques for detecting cloud attacks. Our approach leverages a realistic dataset consisting of both benign and fourteen common attack network flows that meet real-world criteria on the AWS cloud platform. We evaluate eight Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) based on ML and DL algorithms, including Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, and Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models. Experimental results demonstrate that the CADS-ML/DL system, specifically the XGBoost model, outperforms the other models, exhibiting an accuracy of 0.9770 and a false error rate of 0.0230. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed XGBoost model on the AWS benchmark CSE-CICIDS2018 dataset, attaining a remarkable accuracy score of 0.9999 and an exceptionally low false error rate of 0.0001. Our findings suggest that AI-based approaches have the potential to detect cloud attacks effectively and contribute to the development of reliable and efficient IDSs for cloud security. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE.","2-s2.0-85164738630"

This emerging technology has increasingly been leveraged successfully for video segmentation, documentation, education, and formative assessment. New, sophisticated platforms allow pre-determined segments chosen by surgeons to be automatically presented without the need to review entire videos. This study aimed to validate and demonstrate the accuracy of the first reported AI-based computer vision algorithm that automatically recognizes surgical steps in videos of totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair. Methods: Videos of TEP procedures were manually labeled by a team of annotators trained to identify and label surgical workflow according to six major steps. For bilateral hernias, an additional change of focus step was also included. The videos were then used to train a computer vision AI algorithm. Performance accuracy was assessed in comparison to the manual annotations. Results: A total of 619 full-length TEP videos were analyzed: 371 were used to train the model, 93 for internal validation, and the remaining 155 as a test set to evaluate algorithm accuracy. The overall accuracy for the complete procedure was 88.8%. Per-step accuracy reached the highest value for the hernia sac reduction step (94.3%) and the lowest for the preperitoneal dissection step (72.2%). Conclusions: These results indicate that the novel AI model was able to provide fully automated video analysis with a high accuracy level. High-accuracy models leveraging AI to enable automation of surgical video analysis allow us to identify and monitor surgical performance, providing mathematical metrics that can be stored, evaluated, and compared. As such, the proposed model is capable of enabling data-driven insights to improve surgical quality and demonstrate best practices in TEP procedures.

The lack of consideration for equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) in the lifecycle of AI within healthcare settings may intensify social and health inequities, potentially causing harm to under-represented populations. This article describes the protocol for a scoping review of the literature relating to integration of EDI in the AI interventions within healthcare setting. The objective of the review is to evaluate what has been done on integrating EDI concepts, principles and practices in the lifecycles of AI interventions within healthcare settings. It also aims to explore which EDI concepts, principles and practices have been integrated into the design, development and implementation of AI in healthcare settings. Method and analysis The scoping review will be guided by the six-step methodological framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley supplemented by Levac et al, and Joanna Briggs Institute methodological framework for scoping reviews. Relevant literature will be identified by searching seven electronic databases in engineering/computer science and healthcare, and searching the reference lists and citations of studies that meet the inclusion criteria. Studies on AI in any healthcare and geographical settings, that have considered aspects of EDI, published in English and French between 2005 and present will be considered. Two reviewers will independently screen titles, abstracts and full-text articles according to inclusion criteria. We will conduct a thematic analysis and use a narrative description to describe the work. Any disagreements will be resolved through discussion with the third reviewer. Extracted data will be summarised and analysed to address aims of the scoping review. Reporting will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews. The study began in April 2022 and is expected to end in September 2023. The database initial searches resulted in 5,745 records when piloted in April 2022. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required. The study will map the available literature on EDI concepts, principles and practices in AI interventions within healthcare settings, highlight the significance of this context, and offer insights into the best practices for incorporating EDI into AI-based solutions in healthcare settings.

Recent progress in medical imaging, especially CT scans, offers new ways of diagnosing and assessing osteoporosis. This review examines the use of AI analysis of CT scans to stratify BMD and diagnose osteoporosis. By summarizing the relevant studies, we aimed to assess the effectiveness, constraints, and potential impact of AI-based osteoporosis classification (severity) via CT. A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov) was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 39 articles were retrieved from the databases, and the key findings were compiled and summarized, including the regions analyzed, the type of CT imaging, and their efficacy in predicting BMD compared with conventional DXA studies. Important considerations and limitations are also discussed. The overall reported accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of AI in classifying osteoporosis using CT images ranged from 61.8% to 99.4%, 41.0% to 100.0%, and 31.0% to 100.0% respectively, with areas under the curve (AUCs) ranging from 0.582 to 0.994. While additional research is necessary to validate the clinical efficacy and reproducibility of these AI tools before incorporating them into routine clinical practice, these studies demonstrate the promising potential of using CT to opportunistically predict and classify osteoporosis without the need for DEXA. © 2023 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85180503379"

New digital and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies allow to develop novel approaches and tools in this area for the transition from standalone models to intelligent decision-support systems (DSSs). However, the literature lacks concepts and guidelines for the design of such systems. In this paper, we offer a generalized decision-making framework for using digital twins in SC stress-testing and resilience analysis as well as delineate how digital twins can contribute to theory development in SC resilience and viability. We position our proposed approach as an intelligent digital twin (iDT) – a human–AI system which visualizes physical SCs in digital form, collects and processes data for modelling using analytics methods, mimics human decision-making rules, and creates new knowledge and decision-making algorithms through human–AI collaboration. We conclude that the iDT supports monitoring, disruption prediction (early signals), event-driven responses, learning, and proactive thinking, integrating proactive and reactive approaches to SC resilience. The iDT helps to make the unknown known and so contributes to the development of a proactive, adaptation-based view on SC resilience and viability.

ML and DL have become attractive technologies for organizations looking to automate repetitive tasks to reduce manual work and free up resources for innovation. Unlike rule-based automation, typically used for standardized and predictable processes, machine learning, especially deep learning, can handle more complex tasks and learn over time, leading to greater accuracy and efficiency improvements. One of such promising applications is to use AI to reduce manual engineering work. This paper discusses a particular case within McDermott where the research team developed a DL model to do a quality check of complex blueprints. We describe the development and the final product of this case—AI-based software for the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) industry that helps to find the design mistakes buried inside very complex engineering drawings called piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs). We also present a cost-benefit analysis and potential scale-up of the developed software. Our goal is to share the successful experience of AI-based product development that can substantially reduce the engineering hours and, therefore, reduce the project's overall costs. The developed solution can also be potentially applied to other EPC companies doing a similar design for complex installations with high safety standards like oil and gas or petrochemical plants because the design errors it captures are common within this industry. It also could motivate practitioners and researchers to create similar products for the various fields within engineering industry. © 2023 The Authors.

While appropriate screening is crucial for early identification and treatment of ROP, current screening guidelines remain limited by inter-examiner variability in screening modalities, absence of local protocol for ROP screening in some settings, a paucity of resources and an increased survival of younger and smaller infants. This review summarizes the advancements and challenges of current innovative technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), and predictive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of ROP. We provide a contemporary overview of AI-based models for detection of ROP, its severity, progression, and response to treatment. To address the transition from experimental settings to real-world clinical practice, challenges to the clinical implementation of AI for ROP are reviewed and potential solutions are proposed. The use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) technology is also explored, providing evaluation of subclinical ROP characteristics that are often imperceptible on fundus examination. Furthermore, we explore several potential biomarkers to reduce the need for invasive procedures, to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy. Finally, we emphasize the need of a symbiotic integration of biologic and imaging biomarkers and AI in ROP screening, where the robustness of biomarkers in early disease detection is complemented by the predictive precision of AI algorithms. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85169535348"

Responsible AI provides a new solution to effectively address these AI potential threats by integrating social/physical rules into AI systems. However, these rules are high-level regulations and ethical principles, which are difficult to be formalized. To this end, we attempt to use the data generated in various AI systems such as cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS) to discover and reflect these rules to provide more responsible services for humans. In this article, we first propose a data-driven responsible CPSS framework. Its core idea is to mine valuable rules through perception, fusion, processing, and analysis of CPSS data, and then use these rules to adaptively optimize CPSS. Based on this framework, three tensor-based couple hidden Markov models (T-CHMMs) are constructed to integrate three responsible features (i.e., timing, periodicity, and correlation) for mining potential and valuable rules. Then, the corresponding tensor-based Baum-Welch (TBW) algorithms are designed to solve their learning problems. Finally, the predictive accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed models and algorithms are verified on three open datasets. The experimental results show that proposed methods have the best performances for various scenarios, which reflects that our methods are more promising and responsible than existing methods.  © 2014 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85153392752"

Early identification of aneurysms on Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA), a frequently used modality for this purpose, is crucial, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms can improve the detection rate and minimize the intra- and inter-rater variability. Thus, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the diagnostic accuracy of deep-learning-based AI algorithms in detecting cerebral aneurysms using CTA. Methods: PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 2015 to July 2023. Eligibility criteria involved studies using fully automated and semi-automatic deep-learning algorithms for detecting cerebral aneurysms on the CTA modality. Eligible studies were assessed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. A diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis was conducted to estimate pooled lesion-level sensitivity, size-dependent lesion-level sensitivity, patient-level specificity, and the number of false positives per image. An enhanced FROC curve was utilized to facilitate comparisons between the studies. Results: Fifteen eligible studies were assessed. The findings indicated that the methods exhibited high pooled sensitivity (0.87, 95% confidence interval: 0.835 to 0.91) in detecting intracranial aneurysms at the lesion level. Patient-level sensitivity was not reported due to the lack of a unified patient-level sensitivity definition. Only five studies involved a control group (healthy subjects), whereas two provided information on detection specificity. Moreover, the analysis of size-dependent sensitivity reported in eight studies revealed that the average sensitivity for small aneurysms (<3 mm) was rather low (0.56). Conclusions: The studies included in the analysis exhibited a high level of accuracy in detecting intracranial aneurysms larger than 3 mm in size. Nonetheless, there is a notable gap that necessitates increased attention and research focus on the detection of smaller aneurysms, the use of a common test dataset, and an evaluation of a consistent set of performance metrics. © 2023 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85178154989"

Methods: The PRISMA-SCR guidelines and JBI methodology guided a literature search in four databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science) for the past 22 years (2000–2022). To account for the release of AI-based chat applications, such as ChatGPT, the literature search was updated to include publications until the end of June 2023. Results: 1384 publications were originally identified and, after screening titles and abstracts, the full text of 87 publications was assessed. Following the assessment of the full text, 10 publications were included for further analysis. The updated literature search identified two additional relevant publications from 2023 were identified and included in the analysis. All 12 publications recommended teaching AI ethics in medical curricula due to the potential implications of AI in medicine. Anticipated ethical challenges such as bias were identified as the recommended basis for teaching content in addition to basic principles of medical ethics. Case-based teaching using real-world examples in interactive seminars and small groups was recommended as a teaching modality. Conclusion: This scoping review reveals a scarcity of literature on teaching AI ethics in medical education, with most of the available literature being recent and theoretical. These findings emphasize the importance of more empirical studies and foundational definitions of AI ethics to guide the development of teaching content and modalities. Recognizing AI’s significant impact of AI on medicine, additional research on the teaching of AI ethics in medical education is needed to best prepare medical students for future ethical challenges. © 2023 The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85174594070"

In 90 examinations (30 per group) diameters were reassessed for intra- and inter-reader variability, which was compared to discrepancy of the AI system using Bland-Altman analysis, paired samples t-testing and linear mixed models. Results: We analyzed 240 participants (63 ± 16 years; 50 % men). AI evaluation failed in 11 cases due to incorrect segmentation (4.6 %), leaving 229 cases for analysis. No difference was found in aortic diameter between manual and automatic measurements (32.7 ± 6.4 mm vs 32.7 ± 6.0 mm, p = 0.70). Bland-Altman analysis yielded no systematic bias and a repeatability coefficient of 4.0 mm for AI. Mean discrepancy of AI (1.3 ± 1.6 mm) was comparable to inter-reader variability (1.4 ± 1.4 mm); only at the proximal aortic arch showed AI higher discrepancy (2.0 ± 1.8 mm vs 0.9 ± 0.9 mm, p < 0.001). No difference between AI discrepancy and inter-reader variability was found for any subgroup (all: p > 0.05). Conclusion: The AI software can accurately measure thoracic aortic diameters, with discrepancy to a human reader similar to inter-reader variability in a range from normal to dilated aortas. © 2023 The Authors","2-s2.0-85171568560"

In recent years, with the development of new algorithms and the boost in computational power, many popular games played by humans have been solved by AI systems. Mahjong is one of the most popular games played in China and has been spread worldwide, which presents challenges for AI research due to its multi-agent nature, rich hidden information, and complex scoring rules, but it has been somehow overlooked in the community of game AI research. In 2020 and 2022, we held two AI competitions of Official International Mahjong, the standard variant of Mahjong rules, in conjunction with a top-tier AI conference called IJCAI. We are the first to adopt the duplicate format in evaluating Mahjong AI agents to mitigate the high variance in this game. By comparing the algorithms and performance of AI agents in the competitions, we conclude that supervised learning and reinforcement learning are the current state-of-the-art methods in this game and perform much better than heuristic methods based on human knowledge. We also held a human-versus-AI competition and found that the top AI agent still could not beat professional human players.

Although AI systems bring many benefits, several legal and regulatory challenges remain as well. A field that has already attracted much attention is extra-contractual and product liability for damage involving AI systems. Accidents involving self-driving vehicles or surgical robots surely are a reason why tort and product liability are increasingly being discussed. Another reason relates to the intrinsic characteristics of AI such as opaqueness, autonomy, connectivity, data dependency or self-learning abilities, which make it difficult to trace back potentially problematic decisions made with the involvement of such systems. The attention for this academic field will only increase following the recent proposal by the European Commission (EC) regarding new liability rules for AI. Instead of focusing on one specific element, giving a rather general overview of the impact of AI on tort law or discussing the new rules, this article will take a more conceptual perspective and show that each policy decision regarding tort liability for damage involving AI actually entails several additional choices to be made. We will illustrate this with two use cases, namely the allocation of the burden of proof in an AI-context on the one hand and the adoption of strict liability regimes on the other hand. This starting point is important as normative recommendations and proposals risk to be one-layered and, consequently, too ‘simple’ or not realistic to directly implement. Our research emphasizes the ‘multi-faceted’ reality of any proposal regarding the adoption of a new liability regime or modification to existing rules. © 2023 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.","2-s2.0-85166942163"

Yields of detection can be low due to the paroxysmal nature of the disease. Prolonged heart rhythm monitoring might be needed to increase yield but can be cumbersome and expensive. The aim of this study was to observe the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI)based network to predict paroxysmal AF from a normal sinus rhythm single-lead ECG. Methods and results A convolutional neural network model was trained and evaluated using data from three AF screening studies. A total of 478 963 single-lead ECGs from 14 831 patients aged ≥65 years were included in the analysis. The training set included ECGs from 80% of participants in SAFER and STROKESTOP II. The remaining ECGs from 20% of participants in SAFER and STROKESTOP II together with all participants in STROKESTOP I were included in the test set. The accuracy was estimated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). From a single timepoint ECG, the artificial intelligence–based algorithm predicted paroxysmal AF in the SAFER study with an AUC of 0.80 [confidence interval (CI) 0.78–0.83], which had a wide age range of 65–90+ years. Performance was lower in the age-homogenous groups in STROKESTOP I and STROKESTOP II (age range: 75–76 years), with AUCs of 0.62 (CI 0.61–0.64) and 0.62 (CI 0.58–0.65), respectively.

This study aimed to develop and validate an automated segmentation tool based on a deep learning algorithm for accurate 3D reconstruction of the TMJ. Materials and methods: A three-step deep-learning approach based on a 3D U-net was developed to segment the condyles and glenoid fossae on CBCT datasets. Three 3D U-Nets were utilized for region of interest (ROI) determination, bone segmentation, and TMJ classification. The AI-based algorithm was trained and validated on 154 manually segmented CBCT images. Two independent observers and the AI algorithm segmented the TMJs of a test set of 8 CBCTs. The time required for the segmentation and accuracy metrics (intersection of union, DICE, etc.) was calculated to quantify the degree of similarity between the manual segmentations (ground truth) and the performances of the AI models. Results: The AI segmentation achieved an intersection over union (IoU) of 0.955 and 0.935 for the condyles and glenoid fossa, respectively. The IoU of the two independent observers for manual condyle segmentation were 0.895 and 0.928, respectively (p<0.05). The mean time required for the AI segmentation was 3.6 s (SD 0.9), whereas the two observers needed 378.9 s (SD 204.9) and 571.6 s (SD 257.4), respectively (p<0.001). Conclusion: The AI-based automated segmentation tool segmented the mandibular condyles and glenoid fossae with high accuracy, speed, and consistency. Potential limited robustness and generalizability are risks that cannot be ruled out, as the algorithms were trained on scans from orthognathic surgery patients derived from just one type of CBCT scanner. Clinical significance: The incorporation of the AI-based segmentation tool into diagnostic software could facilitate 3D qualitative and quantitative analysis of TMJs in a clinical setting, particularly for the diagnosis of TMJ disorders and longitudinal follow-up. © 2023 The Author(s)","2-s2.0-85150030763"

For instance, it is used locally, as part of a sensor system, on the edge for low-latency high-performance inference, or in the cloud, e.g. for data mining. Modern complex systems, such as connected vehicles, are often part of an Internet of Things (IoT). This poses additional architectural challenges. To manage complexity, architectures are described with architecture frameworks, which are composed of a number of architectural views connected through correspondence rules. Despite some attempts, the definition of a mathematical foundation for architecture frameworks that are suitable for the development of distributed AI systems still requires investigation and study. In this paper, we propose to extend the state of the art on architecture framework by providing a mathematical model for system architectures, which is scalable and supports co-evolution of different aspects for example of an AI system. Based on Design Science Research, this study starts by identifying the challenges with architectural frameworks in a use case of distributed AI systems. Then, we derive from the identified challenges four rules, and we formulate them by exploiting concepts from category theory. We show how compositional thinking can provide rules for the creation and management of architectural frameworks for complex systems, for example distributed systems with AI. The aim of the paper is not to provide viewpoints or architecture models specific to AI systems, but instead to provide guidelines based on a mathematical formulation on how a consistent framework can be built up with existing, or newly created, viewpoints. To put in practice and test the approach, the identified and formulated rules are applied to derive an architectural framework for the EU Horizon 2020 project “Very efficient deep learning in the IoT” (VEDLIoT) in the form of a case study. © 2022 The Author(s)","2-s2.0-85146698508"

While agreeing with Li et al.'s call for further studies on equity issues related to AI, we emphasize the need for science educators to adapt to the AI revolution that has outpaced the research community. We challenge the somewhat restrictive view of formative assessment presented by Li et al., highlighting the significant contributions of AI in providing formative feedback to students, assisting teachers in assessment practices, and aiding in instructional decisions. We contend that AI-generated scores should not be equated with the entirety of formative assessment practice; no single assessment tool can capture all aspects of student thinking and backgrounds. We address concerns raised by Li et al. regarding AI bias and emphasize the importance of empirical testing and evidence-based arguments in referring to bias. We assert that AI-based formative assessment does not necessarily lead to inequity and can, in fact, contribute to more equitable educational experiences. Furthermore, we discuss how AI can facilitate the diversification of representational modalities in assessment practices and highlight the potential benefits of AI in saving teachers’ time and providing them with valuable assessment information. We call for a shift in perspective, from viewing AI as a problem to be solved to recognizing its potential as a collaborative tool in education. We emphasize the need for future research to focus on the effective integration of AI in classrooms, teacher education, and the development of AI systems that can adapt to diverse teaching and learning contexts. We conclude by underlining the importance of addressing AI bias, understanding its implications, and developing guidelines for best practices in AI-based formative assessment. © 2023 The Authors.

We investigate using moral axioms and rules of deontic logic in a norm learning framework to mitigate adversarial norm training. This model of moral intuition and construction provides AI systems with moral guard rails yet still allows for learning conventions. We evaluate our approach by drawing inspiration from a study commonly used in moral development research. This questionnaire aims to test an agent's ability to reason to moral conclusions despite opposed testimony. Our findings suggest that our model can still correctly evaluate moral situations and learn conventions in an adversarial training environment. We conclude that adding axiomatic moral prohibitions and deontic inference rules to a norm learning model makes it less vulnerable to adversarial attacks.

For example, water bodies in Ghana that are polluted amounts to 60% with most of them in deteriorating condition. However, to live a sustainable life, there is the need to follow rules of environmental management, where pollution control and advanced treatment technologies are imperative. The adoption of control strategies and advanced technologies in galamsey-affected-water basins in Ghana will help provide real-time revitalization for supply of quality water. The control strategies for water pollution management and advanced technologies would particularly help utility companies in ensuring that all Ghanaians continue to get potable, reliable, and sustainable water supplies for the current and future generations. The paper covers three key control strategies for water pollution management, vis-à-vis six major aspects of advanced technologies and the use of artificial intelligence (AI). AI based decision-making tools help optimize the use of various treatment technologies, such as adsorption, ion exchanges, electrokinetic processes, chemical precipitation, phytobial remediation, and membrane technology to effectively remove pollutants from affected water bodies. The paper also focuses on advantages and disadvantages of several advanced technologies, challenges on leveraging the technologies while identifying gaps, and possible technology roadmap. The review contributes to water quality issues in Ghana's Pra river basin by embracing AI and other cutting-edge technologies to address the current water pollution crisis and also ensure sustainable and secure water supply for future generations.

At the same time, it will inevitably impact the existing social order and raise ethical concerns. Ethical issues, such as privacy leakage, discrimination, unemployment, and security risks, brought about by AI systems have caused great trouble to people. Therefore, AI ethics, which is a field related to the study of ethical issues in AI, has become not only an important research topic in academia, but also an important topic of common concern for individuals, organizations, countries, and society. This article will give a comprehensive overview of this field by summarizing and analyzing the ethical risks and issues raised by AI, ethical guidelines and principles issued by different organizations, approaches for addressing ethical issues in AI, and methods for evaluating the ethics of AI.

Traditional rule-based and signature-based approaches have been hindered by the introduction of network encryption methods. With the emergence of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), several preliminary works have been developed for anomaly detection in encrypted network traffic. However, complex Artificial Intelligence (AI) models like neural networks lack explainability, limiting the understanding of their predictions. To address this limitation, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged, aiming to provide users with a rationale for understanding AI system outputs and fostering trust. However, existing explainable frameworks still lack comprehensive support for adversarial attacks and defenses. In this paper, we present Montimage AI Platform (MAIP), a new GUI-based deep learning framework for malicious traffic detection and classification combined with its ability of explaining the decision of the model. We employ popular XAI methods to interpret the prediction of the developed deep learning model. Furthermore, we perform adversarial attacks to assess the accountability and robustness of our model via different quantifiable metrics. We perform extensive experiments with both public and private network traffic. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves high performance and robustness, and its outcomes align closely with the domain knowledge. © 2023 Owner/Author.","2-s2.0-85169683137"

However, practitioners lack actionable instructions to operationalise ethics during AI systems development. A literature review of different ethical guidelines revealed inconsistencies in the principles addressed and the terminology used to describe them. Furthermore, requirements engineering (RE), which is identified to foster trustworthiness in the AI development process from the early stages was observed to be absent in a lot of frameworks that support the development of ethical and trustworthy AI. This incongruous phrasing combined with a lack of concrete development practices makes trustworthy AI development harder. To address these concerns, we formulated a comparison table for the terminology used and the coverage of the ethical AI principles in major ethical AI guidelines. We then examined the applicability of ethical AI development frameworks for performing effective RE during the development of trustworthy AI systems.

The operation of complex systems such as a manufacturing line is knowledge-intensive, especially if the operator must frequently reconfigure it for different products. Considering the breadth and dynamic nature of this knowledge, existing solutions for sharing knowledge (e.g., word-of-mouth, issue reports, document creation, and decision support systems) are inefficient and/or resource-intensive. Conversational user interfaces are an efficient way to convey information that mimics the way humans share knowledge; however, we know little about how to design them specifically for this purpose, especially regarding tacit knowledge. In this work, my main goal is to investigate how a cognitive assistant can be designed to facilitate (tacit) knowledge transfer between users of dynamic complex systems.

Applications of FER in healthcare, security, safe driving, and so forth have contributed to the credibility of these methods and their adoption in human-computer interaction for intelligent outcomes. Computational FER mimics human facial expression coding skills and conveys important cues that complement speech to assist listeners. Similarly, FER methods based on deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been developed with edge modules to ensure efficiency and real-time processing. To this end, numerous studies have explored different aspects of FER. Surveys of FER have focused on the literature on hand-crafted techniques, with a focus on general methods for local servers but largely neglecting edge vision-inspired deep learning and AI-based FER technologies. To consider these missing aspects, in this study, the existing literature on FER is thoroughly analyzed and surveyed, and the working flow of FER methods, their integral and intermediate steps, and pattern structures are highlighted. Further, the limitations in existing FER surveys are discussed. Next, FER datasets are investigated in depth, and the associated challenges and problems are discussed. In contrast to existing surveys, FER methods are considered for edge vision (on e.g., smartphone or Raspberry Pi, devices, etc.), and different measures to evaluate the performance of FER methods are comprehensively discussed. Finally, recommendations and some avenues for future research are suggested to facilitate further development and implementation of FER technologies. © 2023 THE AUTHORS","2-s2.0-85147953411"

Many governmental and non-governmental organisations and research institutes are contributing to the COVID-19 fight to control the pandemic. Motivation Numerous telehealth applications have been proposed and adopted during the pandemic to combat the spread of the disease. To this end, powerful tools such as artificial intelligence (AI)/robotic technologies, tracking, monitoring, consultation apps and other telehealth interventions have been extensively used. However, there are several issues and challenges that are currently facing this technology. Objective The purpose of this scoping review is to analyse the primary goal of these techniques; document their contribution to tackling COVID-19; identify and categorise their main challenges and future direction in fighting against the COVID-19 or future pandemic outbreaks. Methods Four digital libraries (ACM, IEEE, Scopus and Google Scholar) were searched to identify relevant sources. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) was used as a guideline procedure to develop a comprehensive scoping review. General telehealth features were extracted from the studies reviewed and analysed in the context of the intervention type, technology used, contributions, challenges, issues and limitations. Results A collection of 27 studies were analysed. The reported telehealth interventions were classified into two main categories: AI-based and non-AI-based interventions; their main contributions to tackling COVID-19 are in the aspects of disease detection and diagnosis, pathogenesis and virology, vaccine and drug development, transmission and epidemic predictions, online patient consultation, tracing, and observation; 28 telehealth intervention challenges/issues have been reported and categorised into technical (14), non-technical (10), and privacy, and policy issues (4). The most critical technical challenges are: network issues, system reliability issues, performance, accuracy and compatibility issues. Moreover, the most critical non-technical issues are: the skills required, hardware/software cost, inability to entirely replace physical treatment and people's uncertainty about using the technology. Stringent laws/regulations, ethical issues are some of the policy and privacy issues affecting the development of the telehealth interventions reported in the literature. Conclusion This study provides medical and scientific scholars with a comprehensive overview of telehealth technologies' current and future applications in the fight against COVID-19 to motivate researchers to continue to maximise the benefits of these techniques in the fight against pandemics.

The goal of this paper is to analyze the changing needs of entrepreneurial decision-making to exhaust the innovation potential of AI-driven big data value chains taking into account AI-specific ethical, security and privacy regulations. The analytical concept of AI-powered big data virtual networks is investigated with a focus on the governance of 5G-based big data value chains required for Internet of Things (IoT) applications in particular smart networks. Although several actors may be involved—such as broadband providers, cloud service providers, geopositioning service providers, or sensor network service providers—the final responsibility for bundling these different service components lies in the hands of the AI-powered big data virtual network providers. In addition to the required data privacy and security regulations, the exploration of new liability rules for AI interacting with traditional technologies is becoming relevant, taking into account AI-specific ethical and transparency obligations. Firstly, the complementary roles of the EU data regulatory framework and European AI regulatory framework are examined. Secondly, the network economic concept of AI-powered big data virtual networks is elaborated taking into account the required regulations. Thirdly, the heterogeneity of AI systems—required for a variety of IoT applications—is considered, with a particular focus on the application of AI within the transportation sector. © The Author(s) 2023.","2-s2.0-85162858674"

In this article, we present an influence-based nano fuzzy swarm (INFS) for oxygen deficiency detection and therapy using a swarm of oxygen carrier nanomachines operating in three cognitive fields of control, influence, and interest. In particular, we propose a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep neural network for detecting apnea by analyzing the irregular peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) signal. Using the proposed sleep-in-the-loop strategy and the desaturated blood biomarkers, including oxygen and hydrogen ion concentrations, an in-silico multithreshold nano fuzzy swarm noninvasive therapeutic method is then performed. We also analytically prove the stability of the INFS using swarm control theory. We apply our strategy to sleep apnea, as one of the most common instances of oxygen deficiency. Furthermore, we compare the accuracy of INSF by using LSTM, bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and support vector machines (SVM). The detection and therapy results are then compared with other apnea detection methods. The input variables and structure of INSF, i.e., the number of rules and width of membership functions, are studied in terms of robustness to noise. As the results show, the proposed artificial intelligence (AI)-based noninvasive nano detection and therapy method could outperform the competing approaches in treating oxygen deficiency emergencies such as apnea.  © 2022 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85153341617"

Supercapacitors can be used with battery technology to create an effective energy storage system due to their qualities and precise characterization. Studies have shown that the use of quantum dots as electrodes in supercapacitors can significantly increase their effectiveness. In this research article, we have used a Drude model based on free electrons (asymmetric nature) to describe the supercapacitor’s discharging characteristics. Commercially available Nippon DLA and Green-cap supercapacitors were used to verify the Drude model by discharging them through a constant current source using a simple current mirror circuit. The parameters of both the fractional-order models and our suggested method were estimated using the least-squares regression fitting approach. An intriguing finding from the Drude model is the current-dependent behavior of the leakage-parallel resistance in the constant current discharge process. Instead of using the traditional exponential rule, supercapacitors discharge according to a power law. This work reflects the strong symmetry of different aspects of designing a hybrid supercapacitor with high efficiency and reliability. © 2023 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85156164959"

The virus is spread through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and it can lead to a range of symptoms, from mild to severe. Some people may not have any symptoms at all and can still spread the virus to others. The best way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is to practice good hygiene. It is also important to follow the guidelines set by local health authorities, such as physical distancing and quarantine measures. The World Health Organization (WHO), on the other hand, has classified this virus as a pandemic, and as a result, all nations are attempting to exert control and secure all public spaces. The current study aimed to (I) compare the weekly COVID-19 cases between Israel and Greece, (II) compare the monthly COVID-19 mortality cases between Israel and Greece, (III) evaluate and report the influence of the vaccination rate on COVID-19 mortality cases in Israel, and (IV) predict the number of COVID-19 cases in Israel. The advantage of completing these tasks is the minimization of the spread of the virus by deploying different mitigations. To attain our objective, a correlation analysis was carried out, and two distinct artificial intelligence (AI)-based models—specifically, an artificial neural network (ANN) and a classical multiple linear regression (MLR)—were developed for the prediction of COVID-19 cases in Greece and Israel by utilizing related variables as the input variables for the models. For the evaluation of the models, four evaluation metrics (determination coefficient (R2), mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R)) were considered in order to determine the performance of the deployed models. From a variety of perspectives, the corresponding determination coefficient (R2) demonstrated the statistical advantages of MLR over the ANN model by following a linear pattern. The MLR predictive model was both efficient and accurate, with 98% accuracy, while ANN showed 94% accuracy in the effective prediction of COVID-19 cases. © 2023 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85152528287"

In its application fields, which are science, technology, engineering, and business, the implementation of rule-based AI systems leads to benefits such as accuracy and correctness of design, and personalization of the process itself and the results. An algorithmic AI suite is based on design and logical imitation models alone, without creating and/or using Big Data and knowledge bases. Excessive complexity of configuration and high design resource capacity, which are inherent in deterministic systems, are balanced by a special methodology. A hierarchical modeling approach gives a quasi-dynamic network effect, symmetric to the analogous effect in neural networks. System performance is improved by deterministic reference training capable of modifying imitation models in online interaction with users. Such training, which serves as an alternative to neural machine learning, can be implemented by means of experimental partially empirical algorithms and system–user dialogues to build reference model libraries (portfolios). Partially empirical algorithms based on experimental design methods and system user dialogues are used to create reference model libraries (portfolios) that form a deterministic training system, which can be an alternative to neural machine learning. Estimated resources can be saved by using modified optimization techniques and by controlling the computational complexity of the algorithms. Since the proposed system in the considered layout has no analogues, and the relevant research and practical knowledge are extremely limited, special methods are required to implement this project. A gradual, phased implementation process involves the step-by-step formation of sets of algorithms with verification tests at each stage. Each test is performed using an iteration method, and each test includes test, tweak, and modification cycles. Final testing should lead to the development of an AI algorithm package, including related methodological and working papers. © 2023 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85164793973"

Large language models (LLMs), a form of AI, are capable of generating high-quality, humanlike text. We investigate the persuasive quality of AI-generated messages to understand how AI could impact public health messaging. Specifically, through a series of studies designed to characterize and evaluate generative AI in developing public health messages, we analyze COVID-19 pro-vaccination messages generated by GPT-3, a state-of-the-art instantiation of a large language model. Study 1 is a systematic evaluation of GPT-3's ability to generate pro-vaccination messages. Study 2 then observed peoples' perceptions of curated GPT-3-generated messages compared to human-authored messages released by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), finding that GPT-3 messages were perceived as more effective, stronger arguments, and evoked more positive attitudes than CDC messages. Finally, Study 3 assessed the role of source labels on perceived quality, finding that while participants preferred AI-generated messages, they expressed dispreference for messages that were labeled as AI-generated. The results suggest that, with human supervision, AI can be used to create effective public health messages, but that individuals prefer their public health messages to come from human institutions rather than AI sources.

They can also act as indicators of 'pro-innovation' economic support for digital technologies. The extent to which regulatory agencies can fulfil their regulatory remit, aimed at the protection of the public good, and signal support for innovative and disruptive technologies is an open policy question. Regulatory sandbox schemes are comparatively new anticipatory tools, operating within a small number of regulators, and their potential to assess contextual or cross-sectoral risk is unclear. However, emerging proposals for the regulation of AI increasing feature various models of regulatory sandboxes often aligned to the need to reduce access barriers for SMEs and innovators. Examples include the European Commission's Proposal for a regulation concerning AI [3] and the recent United Kingdom AI White Paper, AI Regulation: A Pro-Innovation Approach [8]. Disentangling the causal dimensions of why regulatory sandboxes are proposed to regulate AI, and their utility as tools of pre-emptive risk assessment are my core research questions. The regulation of emerging digital technologies present challenges for regulators and governments in monitoring rapid global developments and in anticipating novel forms of risk [9]. Nesta introduced the term anticipatory regulation, and such approaches potentially provide 'a set of behaviours and tools - i.e., a way of working - that is intended to help regulators identify, build and test solutions to emerging challenges' [4]. Regulatory sandboxes are a prominent, and arguably the most widespread, example of such an anticipatory regulatory tool. Whilst there are varied definitions of regulatory sandbox schemes, existing schemes allow small-scale, live testing of innovations in a controlled environment under the supervision of a regulatory authority [6]. A small number of regulatory sandbox schemes are in operation within the UK operating within sectoral and cross-sectoral regulatory remits. However, empirical data and academic literature regarding the methodologies and operation of these current schemes, and literature exploring regulatory sandboxes more broadly, is scarce [7, 10]. The ontological focus of my work is critical realist, which accepts the external reality of the design and instrumental aims of sandbox schemes, whilst seeking to understand the underlying causes and drivers for their use and rapid promotion. To locate such causes and explanations it is necessary to examine existing schemes within the 'rules and norms' of their institutional context and structures [1, 2]. Institutional analysis will isolate the key dimensions of each scheme, consider the influence of the regulatory structures, and then test such analysis through empirical research with regulatory and policy actors. The core hypothesis of my research is that regulatory contexts, path dependencies and conceptions of risk are significant causal elements within existing sandbox schemes and, as such, may present a challenge when designing and deploying cross-sectoral sandbox schemes for AI systems. I have already undertaken analysis of the two regulatory sandbox schemes applying the Institutional Analysis and Development framework of Elinor Ostrom [5]. This analysis has highlighted significant dimensions of sandbox schemes including the role and forms of sectoral incentives for participants, how knowledge and conceptions of risk are shared and the potential role of participatory processes and stakeholders. I am drafting a forthcoming paper outlining a typology of incentives for existing regulatory sandbox schemes. I have included policy and wider sectoral stakeholders within my data collection to obtain perspectives regarding perceived utility, understandings, and conceptions of sandbox schemes. Incorporating collaborative processes and inclusive engagement with affected stakeholders is a key principle of anticipatory regulation [4]. The role and extent of such engagement within proposed sandbox schemes for AI is a further dimension of my research to consider how such processes may be developed and operationalised. This work is undertaken at a time of rapid progression within AI systems and in the development of proposed AI regulation and varied forms of decentralised AI governance.

As an essential protocol to solve service-based communication, Scalable service-Oriented MiddlewarE over IP (SOME/IP) is expected to be applied to an in-vehicle network (IVN). The increasing number of external attack interfaces and the protocol’s vulnerability makes SOME/IP in-vehicle networks vulnerable to intrusion. This paper proposes a multi-layer intrusion detection system (IDS) architecture, including rule-based and artificial intelligence (AI)-based modules. The rule-based module is used to detect the SOME/IP header, SOME/IP-SD message, message interval, and communication process. The AI-based module acts on the payload. We propose a SOME/IP dataset establishment method to evaluate the performance of the proposed multi-layer IDS. Experiments are carried out on a Jetson Xavier NX, showing that the accuracy of AI-based detection reached 99.7761% and that of rule-based detection was 100%. The average detection time per packet is 0.3958 ms with graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration and 0.6669 ms with only a central processing unit (CPU). After vehicle-level real-time analyses, the proposed IDS can be deployed for distributed or select critical advanced driving assistance system (ADAS) traffic for detection in a centralized layout. © 2023 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85159166938"

To empower children growing up with AI to navigate society’s evolving sociotechnical context, we developed three middle school AI literacy curricula: Creative AI, Dancing with AI, and How to Train Your Robot. In this paper we discuss how we leveraged three design principles—active learning, embedded ethics, and low barriers to access – to effectively engage students in learning to create and critique AI artifacts. During the summer of 2020, we recruited and trained in-service, middle school teachers from across the United States to co-instruct online workshops with students from their schools. In the workshops, a combination of hands-on unplugged and programming activities facilitated students’ understanding of AI. As students explored technical concepts in tandem with ethical ones, they developed a critical lens to better grasp how AI systems work and how they impact society. We sought to meet the specified needs of students from a range of backgrounds by minimizing the prerequisite knowledge and technology resources students needed to participate. Finally, we conclude with lessons learned and design recommendations for future AI curricula, especially for K-12 in-person and virtual learning. © 2022, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85135260266"

This study delves into the amalgamation of AI and empirical techniques to attain highly precise outcomes in the evaluation of slope stability. Specifically, our primary objective is to propose innovative and efficient methods by investigating the integration of AI within the well-regarded Qslope system, renowned for its efficacy in analyzing rock slope stability. Given the complexities inherent in rock characteristics, particularly in coastal regions, the Qslope system necessitates adjustments and harmonization with other geomechanical methodologies. Uncertainties prevalent in rock engineering, compounded by water-related factors, warrant meticulous consideration during all calculations. To address these complexities, we present a novel approach through the infusion of fuzzy set theory into the Qslope classification, leveraging fuzziness to effectively quantify and accommodate uncertainties. Our approach employs a sophisticated fuzzy algorithm encompassing six inputs, three outputs, and 756 fuzzy rules, thereby enabling a robust assessment of rock slope stability in coastal regions. The implementation of this method capitalizes on the high-level programming language Python, enhancing computational efficiency. To validate the potency of our AI-based approach, we conducted preliminary tests on slope instabilities within coastal zones, indicating a promising initial direction. The results underwent thorough evaluation, affirming the precision and dependability of the proposed method. However, it is crucial to emphasize that this work represents a first attempt to apply AI to the evaluation of rock slope stability. Our findings underscore a high degree of concurrence and expeditious stability assessment, vital for timely and effective hazard mitigation. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that the reliability of this innovative method must be established through broader applications across diverse scenarios. The proposed AI-based approach’s effectiveness is validated through a preliminary survey on a slope instability case within a coastal region, and its potential merits must be substantiated through broader validation efforts. © 2023 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85168801846"

We investigate this by interviewing ten Finnish SE executives in middle and higher-level management to examine how they consider and implement ethical requirements. We use ethical requirements from the European Union (EU) Trustworthy Ethics guidelines for Trustworthy AI as our reference for ethical requirements and an Agile portfolio management framework to analyze implementation. Our findings reveal a general consideration of privacy and data governance ethical requirements as legal requirements with no other consideration for ethical requirements identified.

This research area works on sensing and actuation and reasoning to find the exact location and amount of damage in a structure. The amount of damage must be quantified as to avoid serious catastrophic failure. For the above-mentioned purpose, the current method has been proposed. There are conventional and unconventional methods of damage detection. In the conventional methods, regular NDT methods are used. Among various Artificial Intelligent (AI) based methods, Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) is the one that can code and recode numerical inputs into semantic points, but the procedure of designing the fuzzy rule is troublesome and can turn out to be extremely confounded if the number of input and output parameters are increased. The combination of Fuzzy Logic with Genetic Algorithm (GA) provides an advanced hybrid intelligent algorithm called the automatic generation fuzzy rules, which generates the fuzzy rules automatically from the data. Here, a methodology is proposed for the automatic optimization of the fuzzy rules for the crack assessment in structure. At first, both FLS and GA approaches are implemented to present problem and obtain the results. In this analogy (hybrid-fuzzy), fuzzy rules are optimized with the fuzzy membership functions (MFs) and as rules of fuzzy comprises of fuzzy MFs also. Different GA operators like selection, crossover and mutation are implemented to optimize the fuzzy rules. A special type of objective function has been developed using absoluteness and factor of rules for the novel method and the results are obtained. A numerical model is formed for the entire analyses. The proposed method requires data collection. So, for this, the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) has been used. The data were collected from the FEA and Experimental analysis and then converted to normalized form. The data are normalized so, that the application in the given algorithm will be easier. The acquired results from the current analogy are validated with those of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) method. The same results are also compared with FLS and GA separately. From the results, it was obtained that the method convergence well and will be suitable for condition monitoring structures. © 2023 Jordan Journal of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering.

However, there are still relatively few case studies that describe the current state of defining these quality requirements in practice. Objective: This study consisted of two phases. The first goal of our study was to explore what ethical guidelines organizations have defined for the development of transparent and explainable AI systems and then we investigated how explainability requirements can be defined in practice. Methods: In the first phase, we analyzed the ethical guidelines in 16 organizations representing different industries and public sector. Then, we conducted an empirical study to evaluate the results of the first phase with practitioners. Results: The analysis of the ethical guidelines revealed that the importance of transparency is highlighted by almost all of the organizations and explainability is considered as an integral part of transparency. To support the definition of explainability requirements, we propose a model of explainability components for identifying explainability needs and a template for representing explainability requirements. The paper also describes the lessons we learned from applying the model and the template in practice. Contribution: For researchers, this paper provides insights into what organizations consider important in the transparency and, in particular, explainability of AI systems.

NLP techniques have been implemented to analyse large volumes of text from social media platforms to gain insights on disease symptoms, understand barriers to care and predict disease outbreaks. However, AI-based decisions may contain biases that could misrepresent populations, skew results or lead to errors. Bias, within the scope of this paper, is described as the difference between the predictive values and true values within the modelling of an algorithm. Bias within algorithms may lead to inaccurate healthcare outcomes and exacerbate health disparities when results derived from these biased algorithms are applied to health interventions. Researchers who implement these algorithms must consider when and how bias may arise. This paper explores algorithmic biases as a result of data collection, labelling and modelling of NLP algorithms. Researchers have a role in ensuring that efforts towards combating bias are enforced, especially when drawing health conclusions derived from social media posts that are linguistically diverse. Through the implementation of open collaboration, auditing processes and the development of guidelines, researchers may be able to reduce bias and improve NLP algorithms that improve health surveillance. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.","2-s2.0-85159161897"

Applying Artificial Intelligence (Al)/Machine Learning (ML), in combination with Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN), seems a promising solution for enabling automation and intelligence that will optimize orchestration operations.

We address this gap by investigating the generalization of specific design solutions into design patterns that can be shared and applied in different contexts. We present a human-centered bottom-up approach for the specification of design solutions and their abstraction into team design patterns.

The study involved multimodal data involving video and electrodermal activities (EDA) data collected from ninety-four secondary school students (N = 94) during five science lessons to reveal trigger events in CL. A novel concept of trigger events is introduced, which are challenging events and/or situations that may inhibit collaboration and will, therefore, require strategic adaptation in the regulation of cognition, motivation, and emotion within the group. The ANOVA results for the Skin Conductance Responses (SCRs) analysis indicated the disparity of physiological behavior activated in relation to different types of interactions for regulation. Process analysis and episode-rule mining were applied to reveal regulatory patterns in CL, while an AI approach with long short-term memory (LSTM) deep-learning networks were designed for pattern prediction. LSTM has emerged as the most widely applied artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture for sequential data analysis and classification. The proposed AI network holds the potential for designing solutions for similar signal-processing problems in studying learning regulation.

With the emergence of the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT), efficient healthcare services can be provided to patients. Healthcare professionals have effectively used AI-based models to analyze the data collected from IoHT devices to treat various diseases. Data must be processed and analyzed while avoiding privacy breaches, in compliance with legal rules and regulations, such as the HIPAA and GDPR. Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning-based approach allowing multiple entities to train an ML model collaboratively without sharing their data. It is particularly beneficial in healthcare, where data privacy and security are substantial concerns. Even though FL addresses some privacy concerns, there is still no formal proof of privacy guarantees for IoHT data. Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) are tools and techniques designed to enhance the privacy and security of online communications and data sharing. PETs provide a range of features that help protect users’ personal information and sensitive data from unauthorized access and tracking. This paper comprehensively reviews PETs concerning FL in the IoHT scenario and identifies several key challenges for future research. © 2023 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85163893152"

We present MolTaut, a tool for the rapid generation of favorable states of drug-like molecules in water. MolTaut works by enumerating possible tautomeric states with tautomeric transformation rules, ranking tautomers with their relative internal energies and solvation energies calculated by AI-based models, and generating preferred ionization states according to predicted microscopic pKa. Our test shows that the ranking ability of the AI-based tautomer scoring approach is comparable to the DFT method (wB97X/6-31G*//M062X/6-31G*/SMD) from which the AI models try to learn. We find that the substitution effect on tautomeric equilibrium is well predicted by MolTaut, which is helpful in computer-aided ligand design.

However, varying ethical and procedural approaches to technological development, research emphasis on offensive uses of AI, and lack of appropriate venues for multistakeholder dialogue have led to differing operationalization of responsible AI principles and practices among civilian and defense entities. We argue that the disconnect between civilian and defense responsible development and use practices leads to underutilization of responsible AI research and hinders the implementation of responsible AI principles in both communities.

However, in practice human decision-makers often lack understanding of what information an AI model has access to, in relation to themselves. There are few available guidelines regarding how to effectively communicate aboutunobservables: features that may influence the outcome, but which are unavailable to the model. In this work, we conducted an online experiment to understand whether and how explicitly communicating potentially relevant unobservables influences how people integrate model outputs and unobservables when making predictions. Our findings indicate that presenting prompts about unobservables can change how humans integrate model outputs and unobservables, but do not necessarily lead to improved performance. Furthermore, the impacts of these prompts can vary depending on decision-makers' prior domain expertise.

A quantitative, modular, AI-based approach for assessing and grading students' collaboration has been examined in this article. The pedagogical underpinning of the approach includes a pedagogical framework and a quantitative soft skill assessment rubric, which have been adapted and used in an extracurricular Java programming course. The objective was to identify pros and cons of using different AI methods within this approach when it comes to assessing and grading collaboration in group programming projects. More specifically, fuzzy rules and several machine learning methods (ML onward) have been examined to see which one would yield the best results regarding performance, interpretability/explainability of recommendations, and feasibility/practicality. The data used for training and testing span four academic years, and the results suggest that almost all of the examined AI methods, when used within the proposed AI-based approach, can provide adequate grading recommendations as long as teachers cover other aspects of the assessment not covered by the rubrics: code quality, plagiarism, and project completion. The fuzzy-rule-based method requires time and effort to be spent on (manual) creation and tuning of fuzzy rules and sets, whereas the examined ML methods require lesser initial investments but do need historical data for training. On the other hand, the fuzzy-rule-based method can provide the best explanations on how the assessment/grading was made - something that proved to be very important to teachers.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85144045464"

Recently, practitioner-facing resources and design guidelines have become available to ease some of these challenges. However, little research has investigated if and how these guidelines are used, and how they impact practice. In this paper, we investigated how industry practitioners use the People + AI Guidebook. We conducted interviews with 31 practitioners (i.e., designers, product managers) to understand how they use human-AI guidelines when designing AI-enabled products. Our findings revealed that practitioners use the guidebook not only for addressing AI's design challenges, but also for education, cross-functional communication, and for developing internal resources. We uncovered that practitioners desire more support for early phase ideation and problem formulation to avoid AI product failures. We discuss the implications for future resources aiming to help practitioners in designing AI products. © 2023 Owner/Author.","2-s2.0-85160013788"

Wide field retinal imaging (WFDRI) and artificial intelligence (AI) have shown promise in the field of ROP and have the potential to improve the diagnostic performance and reduce the workload for screening ophthalmologists. The aim of this review is to systematically review and provide a summary of the diagnostic characteristics of existing deep learning algorithms. Subject/Methods: Two authors independently searched the literature, and studies using a deep learning system from retinal imaging were included. Data were extracted, assessed and reported using PRISMA guidelines. Results: Twenty-seven studies were included in this review. Nineteen studies used AI systems to diagnose ROP, classify the staging of ROP, diagnose the presence of pre-plus or plus disease, or assess the quality of retinal images. The included studies reported a sensitivity of 71%–100%, specificity of 74–99% and area under the curve of 91–99% for the primary outcome of the study. AI techniques were comparable to the assessment of ophthalmologists in terms of overall accuracy and sensitivity. Eight studies evaluated vascular severity scores and were able to accurately differentiate severity using an automated classification score. Conclusion: Artificial intelligence for ROP diagnosis is a growing field, and many potential utilities have already been identified, including the presence of plus disease, staging of disease and a new automated severity score. AI has a role as an adjunct to clinical assessment; however, there is insufficient evidence to support its use as a sole diagnostic tool currently. © 2022, Crown.","2-s2.0-85145088321"

Some commercial DLAS software provide an incremental retraining function that enables users to train a custom model using their institutional data to account for clinical practice variability. Purpose: This study was performed to evaluate and implement the commercial DLAS software with the incremental retraining function for definitive treatment of patients with prostate cancer in a multi-user environment. Methods: CT-based target organs and organs-at-risk (OAR) delineation of 215 prostate cancer patients were utilized. The performance of three commercial DLAS software built-in models was validated with 20 patients. A retrained custom model was developed using 100 patients and evaluated on the remaining data (n = 115). Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), mean surface distance (MSD), and surface DSC (SDSC) were utilized for quantitative evaluation. A multi-rater qualitative evaluation was blindly performed with a five-level scale. Visual inspection was performed in consensus and non-consensus unacceptable cases to identify the failure modes. Results: Three commercial DLAS vendor built-in models achieved sub-optimal performance in 20 patients. The retrained custom model had a mean DSC of 0.82 for prostate, 0.48 for seminal vesicles (SV), and 0.92 for rectum, respectively. This represents a significant improvement over the built-in model with DSC of 0.73, 0.37, and 0.81 for the corresponding structures. Compared to the acceptance rate of 96.5% and consensus unacceptable rate (i.e., both reviewers rated as unacceptable) of 3.5% achieved by manual contours, the custom model achieved a 91.3% acceptance rate and 8.7% consensus unacceptable rate. The failure modes of retrained custom model were attributed to the following: cystogram (n = 2), hip prosthesis (n = 2), low dose rate brachytherapy seeds (n = 2), air in endorectal balloon(n = 1), non-iodinated spacer (n = 2), and giant bladder(n = 1). Conclusion: The commercial DLAS software with the incremental retraining function was validated and clinically adopted for prostate patients in a multi-user environment. AI-based auto-delineation of the prostate and OARs is shown to achieve improved physician acceptance, overall clinical utility, and accuracy. © 2023 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","2-s2.0-85161578624"

Several guidelines have provided reporting standards for publications of AI-based research in medicine and radiology. Yet, there is an unmet need for recommendations on the assessment of AI software before adoption and after commercialization. As the radiology AI ecosystem continues to grow and mature, a formalization of system assessment and evaluation is paramount to ensure patient safety, relevance and support to clinical workflows, and optimal allocation of limited AI development and validation resources before broader implementation into clinical practice. To fulfil these needs, we provide a glossary for AI software types, use cases and roles within the clinical workflow; list healthcare needs, key performance indicators and required information about software prior to assessment; and lay out examples of software performance metrics per software category. This conceptual framework is intended to streamline communication with the AI software industry and provide healthcare decision makers and radiologists with tools to assess the potential use of these software. The proposed software evaluation framework lays the foundation for a radiologist-led prospective validation network of radiology AI software.

At the same time, legal requirements are emerging in various jurisdictions, following a deluge of ethical guidelines. It is therefore key to explore the necessary practices that must be adopted to ensure the quality of AI systems, mitigate their potential risks and enable legal compliance. Ensuring that the potential negative impacts of AI on individuals, society, and the environment are mitigated will depend on many factors, including the capacity to properly regulate its deployment and to mandate necessary internal best practices along lifecycles. Regulatory frameworks must evolve from abstract requirements to providing concrete operational mandates that enable better oversight mechanisms in the way AI systems operate, how they are developed, and how they are deployed. In view of the above, this paper explores the necessary practices that can be adopted throughout a comprehensive lifecycle audit as a key practice to ensure the quality of AI systems and enable the development of compliance mechanisms. It also discusses novel governance tools that enable bridging the current operational gaps. Such gaps were identified by interviewing experts, analysing adaptable tools and methodologies from the software engineering domain, and by exploring the state of the art of auditing.

Real-time fine evolution is challenging due to vast combinations of input features and high-resolution calculated variables. Here, we systematically demonstrate an AI-based methodology for digital twinning of complex composite structures. First, three types of deep neural networks are created with optionally used autoencoders as surrogate models, with architectures and data processing inspired by the rule-of-mixture of composites. Second, the prediction accuracy and efficiency are evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively, demonstrating the feasibility of predicting 3D displacement and stress fields directly from sensing data of temperature, pressure and loading displacement, and the optimal architecture is selected to be the evolving digital twin. Finally, the real-time interactive experiments are relayed to the digital twin and demonstrated that it can interact with physical objects and evolve online with high accuracy. These results indicate that the computational time can be reduced by 3∼6 orders of magnitude with high information intensity and scalability compared with conventional numerical and experimental methods, which opens up the avenues for the cost-effective and efficient development of digital twin services for composites. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85164225086"

This systematic review aims to evaluate the reporting quality of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluate AI technologies applied to ophthalmology. Methods A comprehensive search of three relevant databases (EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane) from 1 January 2010 to 5 February 2022 was conducted. The reporting quality of these papers was scored using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence (CONSORT-AI) checklist and further risk of bias was assessed using the RoB-2 tool. Results The initial search yielded 2973 citations from which 5 articles satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria. These articles featured AI technologies applied to diabetic retinopathy screening, ophthalmologic education, fungal keratitis detection and paediatric cataract diagnosis. None of the articles reported all items in the CONSORT-AI checklist. The overall mean CONSORT-AI score of the included RCTs was 53% (range 37%-78%). The individual scores of the articles were 37% (19/51), 39% (20), 49% (25), 61% (31) and 78% (40). All articles were scored as being moderate risk, or 'some concerns present', regarding potential risk of bias according to the RoB-2 tool. Conclusion A small number of RCTs have been published to date on the applications of AI in ophthalmology and vision science. Adherence to the 2020 CONSORT-AI reporting guidelines is suboptimal with notable reporting items often missed. Greater adherence will help facilitate reproducibility of AI research which can be a stimulus for more AI-based RCTs and clinical applications in ophthalmology.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

However, a specific type of annotation task, the qualitative coding performed during thematic analysis, has characteristics that make effective human-AI collaboration difficult. Informed by a formative study, we designed PaTAT, a new AI-enabled tool that uses an interactive program synthesis approach to learn flexible and expressive patterns over user-annotated codes in real-time as users annotate data. To accommodate the ambiguous, uncertain, and iterative nature of thematic analysis, the use of user-interpretable patterns allows users to understand and validate what the system has learned, make direct fixes, and easily revise, split, or merge previously annotated codes. This new approach also helps human users to learn data characteristics and form new theories in addition to facilitating the ""learning""of the AI model.

However, these models, which contain a large number of parameters, are widely distributed and disseminated by researchers, engineers, and even unauthorized users. Except for intelligent tasks, typically overparameterized deep neural networks have become new digital covers for data hiding, which may pose significant security challenges to AI systems. To address this issue, this paper proposes a symmetric steganalysis scheme specifically designed for neural networks trained for image classification tasks. The proposed method focuses on detecting the presence of additional data without access to the internal structure or parameters of the host network. It employs a well-designed method based on histogram distribution to find the optimal decision threshold, with a symmetric determining rule where the original networks and stego networks undergo two highly symmetrical flows to generate the classification labels; the method has been shown to be practical and effective. SVM and ensemble classifiers were chosen as the binary classifier for their applicability to feature vectors output from neural networks based on different datasets and network structures. This scheme is the first of its kind, focusing on steganalysis for neural networks based on the distribution of network output, compared to conventional digital media such as images, audio, and video. Overall, the proposed scheme offers a promising approach to enhancing the security of deep neural networks against data hiding attacks. © 2023 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85160517950"

Some researchers argue that AI-enable network may run the danger of having private information compromised. We still need a backup rule-based methodology to allocate bandwidth resource to each slice, if the AI-based method suddenly encounters security issues. To design such a rule-based methodology, this study attempts to answer two questions: (1) Is the network slicing bandwidth allocation problem the nondeterministic polynomial-time completeness (NP-completeness)? (2) Is there a heuristic methodology without any training process, which has equivalent performance compared to the AI-based methodology? This study first proves the classical network slicing bandwidth allocation problems is NP-completeness. This shows that the designed heuristic method is inescapably suboptimal to the network slicing bandwidth allocation problem. Secondly, this study proposes the Adaptive Hungarian Algorithm (AHA), which outperforms previous AI-empowered method and does not need any training process. The experiments demonstrate that AHA reached 93%–97% of the maximal system throughput by brute-and-force algorithm, compared to other methodologies only having at most 93% of the maximal system throughput. This also indicates that AHA is capable to solve the network slicing bandwidth allocation problem, if the telecommunication operators do not have sufficient sample complexity to train an AI model. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2-s2.0-85149262047"

AI can use information collected by drone sensors to develop routing protocols, optimize communication networks, improve energy efficiency, and predict user behavior. In this regard, the analysis of data loss in SAGIN with AI is relevant. This work is devoted to the calculation of packet losses in SAGIN, containing additional hardware of AI system. Based on the original model containing a Base Station (BS), a stratospheric Remotely Piloted Air System (RPAS) with an AI system, a low-orbit satellite, a low-altitude RPAS and a user of a terrestrial cellular network, data traffic was simulated using NetCracker Professional 4.1 software. The AI system was simulated by a cloud structure with the ability to change the delay and the probability of packet losses. Quantitative characteristics of traffic in SAGIN channels with such a model of the AI hardware system are obtained. The dependences of packets losses on the size of messages and the data transfer rate are calculated. The dependences of BS uplink Average Load and the packets travel time on the TS, as well as the dependences of the Bit Error Rate (BER) on the Average Load, are obtained.

According to the World Health Organization, gliomas can be graded on a four-stage scale, ranging from the most benign to the most malignant. The grading of these tumors from image information is a far from trivial task for radiologists and one in which they could be assisted by machine-learning-based decision support. However, the machine learning analytical pipeline is also fraught with perils stemming from different sources, such as inadvertent data leakage, adequacy of 2D image sampling, or classifier assessment biases. In this paper, we analyze a glioma database sourced from multiple datasets using a simple classifier, aiming to obtain a reliable tumor grading and, on the way, we provide a few guidelines to ensure such reliability. Our results reveal that by focusing on the tumor region of interest and using data augmentation techniques we significantly enhanced the accuracy and confidence in tumor classifications. Evaluation on an independent test set resulted in an AUC-ROC of 0.932 in the discrimination of low-grade gliomas from high-grade gliomas, and an AUC-ROC of 0.893 in the classification of grades 2, 3, and 4. The study also highlights the importance of providing, beyond generic classification performance, measures of how reliable and trustworthy the model’s output is, thus assessing the model’s certainty and robustness. © 2023 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85164971741"

Four aspects are identified from definitions of pastoral care: the horizon of contingency in mortality, the role of wisdom rather than mere information, the oppressive and/or liberatory potential of AI and the importance of empathic presence. In rejecting a transhumanist argument that mental processes are substrate-independent, it is contended that pastoral carers embrace, rather than seeking to circumvent, their crucial finitude in being humans who care. A distinction is drawn between probabilistic reasoning and judgement in retaining a vital place for decision-making that is social. Whilst not eschewing value in AI systems, this article argues for critical evaluation of technologically framed contributions to addressing barriers to people's participation. The importance of empathy is highlighted—in the light of claims not only of robotic mimicry but of interindividual models of emotion. It is concluded that the notion of artificial care be ruled out although the possibilities of AI-assisted care are not dismissed. Opportunities for humans to abdicate from the responsibilities to care, in favour of AI substitutes, are deemed to be best avoided. © The Author(s) 2023.","2-s2.0-85162934754"

Prior to the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based solutions, it was solved in the 1970s by optimization-based strategies. However, AI-based solutions appeared in the 1980s in a pioneering way, by using a Learning Automaton (LA)-motivated strategy known as the so-called Object Migrating Automaton (OMA). Although the OMA and its derivatives have been used in numerous applications since then, the basic kernel has remained the same. Because the number of possible partitions in a partitioning problem can be combinatorially exponential and the underlying tasks are NP-hard, the most advanced OMA algorithms could, until recently, only solve issues involving equally sized groups. Due to our recent innovations cited in the body of this paper, the enhanced OMA now also handles non-equally sized groups. Earlier, we had presented in Omslandseter (Pattern Anal Appl, 2023), a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art enhancements of the best-known OMA. We believe that these results will be the benchmark for a few decades and that it will be very hard to beat these results. This is a companion paper, intended to augment the contents of Omslandseter (Pattern Anal Appl, 2023). In this paper, we first discuss the OMA’s prior applications, its historical and current innovations, and the OMA-based algorithms’ relevance to societal needs. We also provide well-specified guidelines for future researchers so that they can use them for unresolved tasks, and also develop further advancements. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85152396799"

Due to the nascent nature of these roles, however, it is unclear to future employers and aspiring AI ethicists what specific function these roles serve and what skills are necessary to serve the functions. Without clarity on these, we cannot train future AI ethicists with meaningful learning objectives. In this work, we examine what responsible AI practitioners do in the industry and what skills they employ on the job. We propose an ontology of existing roles alongside skills and competencies that serve each role. We created this ontology by examining the job postings for such roles over a two-year period (2020-2022) and conducting expert interviews with fourteen individuals who currently hold such a role in the industry.

One critical issue in AI research is recognising the ethical issues connected with AI. AI ethics is still very much in formative development, despite the fact that the term ""machine ethics""was coined in 2006 and till today AI ethics is still focusing on the need to investigate the ethics of AI and also how to develop ethical AI. The ethics of AI 1 looks at the ethical values, principles, instructions, norms, and processes associated with AI. The ethics of AI investigates ethical ideals, principles, instructions, rules, and processes related to AI technology. We may therefore develop AI with an ethical mindset by using appropriate AI ethics. Here, the researchers have examined many of most important research in the subject of AI ethics.

Fuzzy logic systems (FLS)-based XAI provides an explainable framework while also modeling uncertainties in real-world environments. However, most real-life processes are not characterized by high uncertainty alone; they are also inherently time dependent, i.e., the processes are time variant. In this work, we present a novel temporal type-2 FLS-based approach for time-dependent XAI (TXAI) systems, which can account for the likelihood of a sample occurrence in the time domain by its the frequency. In the proposed temporal type-2 fuzzy sets (TT2FSs), a 4-D time-dependent membership function integrates the universe of discourse, its membership, and its frequency of occurrence across time. The TXAI system manifested better classification prowess in cross-validation tests, with a mean recall of 95.40% than a standard XAI system (based on nontemporal general type-2 fuzzy sets) that had a mean recall of 87.04%. TXAI also performed significantly better than most nonexplainable AI systems, with between 3.95% and 19.04% improvement gain in mean recall. In addition, TXAI can also outline the most likely time-dependent trajectories using the frequency and time dimensions embedded in the TXAI model; viz. given a rule at a determined time interval, what will be the next most likely rule at a subsequent time interval. In this regard, the proposed TXAI system can have profound implications for delineating the evolution of real-life time-dependent processes, such as behavioral or biological processes.  © 2020 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85139437865"

Meanwhile, DL performs classification based on data patterns and data analyses are performed by themselves. Furthermore, FL utilises human-defined rules to decide the degree to which a person has MCI. A combination of AI techniques enhances the feature preparation phase for ML or DL to perform accurate classification. Conclusion: Although AI-based MCI detection tool is critical for healthcare decision-making, clinical utility and risks remain underexplored. Hopefully, this review equips clinicians with background AI knowledge to address these clinical concerns. Hence, future research should explore more techniques and representative datasets to improve AI development. Relevance to clinical practice: Results of this review can increase the knowledge of AI-based MCI detection tools.

Data analytics experts began exploring beyond conventional data management techniques and shifted toward contemporary solutions like AI-enabled data integration in order to decrease human errors and total costs. Data fabric is a weave where it stretches spanning a wide area that connects numerous sites, various data source kinds, and accessing techniques. As it progresses through the various stages of the data fabric, the data collected from the source can be handled, processed, and stored. For a wide range of applications, the data can also be accessible by or shared with both internal and external apps. Data fabric applications' main objectives are to optimize supply chains for end-to-end products, complywith data rules, and enhance consumer engagement through more sophisticated mobile apps and interactions. Always Companies can gain a competitive edge with data, but to meet customer demands, they must supply data rapidly. Most of the enterprises implemented cloud migration and IoT, with increased cost-effective data storage and processing. Because of this data is no longer tied to local centers, and most of the data are located in different places and it is very difficult to manage [1]. A Data Fabric is a strategic solution to the enterprise to incur storage operations and leverages the best version of cloud migration. This architecture can support centrally managed, public and private clouds, IoT and other devices. This reduces management tasks through automation, accelerates the development and deployment process, and protects assets without interruption. It enables changes to be made quickly, resolving problems, managing risk, reducing IT operations and complying with regulations. In this chapter, the best open source data fabric tools that meet the enterprise requirements are listed and highlighted with its benefits and challenges. The greatest data fabric tools are profiled in one location, which makes it easy for researchers to choose the tool throughout their search. Data categorization and discovery, data quality and profiling, data lineage and governance, and data exploration and integration are the four main functions offered by the data fabric technologies. These data collaboration platforms combine data integration with business applications. Atlan, Cinchy, Data.world, Denodo, IBM, K2 View are few open source tools that are used by enterprise to manage their data and its integration. There are wide ranges of Open Source Data fabric tools that are quick to list its benefits. Instead of using proprietary systems, the majority of firms are interested in open source solutions due to lower costs. The capacity to modify and offer creative solutions on the code to satisfy business objectives is another crucial advantage of working with open source proponents. However, in this chapter we discuss about the Key features, benefits and technical challenges of different open source data integration tools in detail. The primary challenges in the utilizing open source data tool in enterprise is they lack in community support. In general The IT departments of many businesses rely on vendor support to enhance their internal capabilities [2]. Having open source tools, make the enterprise to face and resolve the issues by their own, which is very hard. When developing a data management environment, technology teams frequently underestimate the amount of time and expertise required to properly employ open source software. Most of the organizations they frequently underestimate the amount of work necessary to integrate open source with other subsystems and, as a result, incorrectly evaluate the total cost of ownership of employing open source systems. Most businesses meet few significant obstacles when working on open source pilot projects, but they may run into problems when attempting to manage and maintain those deployments on a wide scale. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

Accordingly, manufacturers that provide submission packages to regulatory agencies are instructed to organize the contents using a structure that enables the information to be easily allocated, retrieved, and reviewed. However, this practice is not always followed correctly; as such, some documents are not well structured, with similar information spreading across different sections, hindering the efficient access and review of all of the relevant data as a whole. To improve this common situation, we evaluated an artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing (NLP) methodology, called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), to automatically classify free-text information into standardized sections, supporting a holistic review of drug safety and efficacy. Specifically, FDA labeling documents were used in this study as a proof of concept, where the labeling section structure defined by the Physician Label Rule (PLR) was used to classify labels in the development of the model. The model was subsequently evaluated on texts from both well-structured labeling documents (i.e., PLR-based labeling) and less- or differently structured documents (i.e., non-PLR and Summary of Product Characteristic [SmPC] labeling.) In the training process, the model yielded 96% and 88% accuracy for binary and multiclass tasks, respectively. The testing accuracies observed for the PLR, non-PLR, and SmPC testing data sets for the binary model were 95%, 88%, and 88%, and for the multiclass model were 82%, 73%, and 68%, respectively. Our study demonstrated that automatically classifying free texts into standardized sections with AI language models could be an advanced regulatory science approach for supporting the review process by effectively processing unformatted documents.

This new era of technological development is exciting, but AI applications are also a cause for concern. If tasks that have hitherto normally been undertaken by human beings are now to be taken care of by ever more intelligent autonomous systems, how can we be certain that such functions are performed diligently and safely? Many areas of application of AI systems have also made the tribulations of AI utilization apparent. The EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) aims to tackle the concerns and challenges related to the utilization of AI, and to develop human-centric, secure, trustworthy, and ethical AI systems for the EU markets. The provisions of the AIA establish a system of compliance assessment that requires AI providers to disclose how high-risk AI systems have been trained and put together. This article will look at the role of disclosure obligations under the provisions of the AIA. The focus is on the tension between obligations to disclose information on the one hand and requirements to protect the trade secrets contained in the technical details of AI on the other. This article will explain how the technical details of AI contain some information that does not qualify for trade secret protection. And even when there are trade secrets, there are exceptions to trade secret protection. Rules to enable access to information form part of the Trade Secrets Directive, but other legislative instruments too enable access and make it necessary to navigate between access and confidentiality. © 2023, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85158119343"

While this recent debate points towards the power asymmetry between those who shape AI systems and those affected by them, the literature lacks normative grounding and misses conceptual clarity on how these power dynamics take shape. In this paper, I develop a workable conceptualization of said power dynamics according to Cristiano Castelfranchi’s conceptual framework of power and argue that end-users depend on a system’s developers and users, because end-users rely on these systems to satisfy their goals, constituting a power asymmetry between developers, users and end-users. I ground my analysis in the neo-republican moral wrong of domination, drawing attention to legitimacy concerns of the power-dependence relation following from the current lack of accountability mechanisms. I illustrate my claims on the basis of a risk-prediction machine learning system, and propose institutional (external auditing) and project-specific solutions (increase contestability through design-for-values approaches) to mitigate domination. © 2022, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85125251069"

We evaluate whether an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for assessing ROP severity in babies can be used to evaluate changes in disease epidemiology in babies from South India over a 5-year period. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Participants: Babies (3093) screened for ROP at neonatal care units (NCUs) across the Aravind Eye Care System (AECS) in South India. Methods: Images and clinical data were collected as part of routine tele-ROP screening at the AECS in India over 2 time periods: August 2015 to October 2017 and March 2019 to December 2020. All babies in the original cohort were matched 1:3 by birthweight (BW) and gestational age (GA) with babies in the later cohort. We compared the proportion of eyes with moderate (type 2) or treatment-requiring (TR) ROP, and an AI-derived ROP vascular severity score (from retinal fundus images) at the initial tele-retinal screening exam for all babies in a district, VSS), in the 2 time periods. Main Outcome Measures: Differences in the proportions of type 2 or worse and TR-ROP cases, and VSS between time periods. Results: Among BW and GA matched babies, the proportion [95% confidence interval {CI}] of babies with type 2 or worse and TR-ROP decreased from 60.9% [53.8%–67.7%] to 17.1% [14.0%–20.5%] (P < 0.001) and 16.8% [11.9%–22.7%] to 5.1% [3.4%–7.3%] (P < 0.001), over the 2 time periods. Similarly, the median [interquartile range] VSS in the population decreased from 2.9 [1.2] to 2.4 [1.8] (P < 0.001). Conclusions: In South India, over a 5-year period, the proportion of babies developing moderate to severe ROP has dropped significantly for babies at similar demographic risk, strongly suggesting improvements in primary prevention of ROP. These results suggest that AI-based assessment of ROP severity may be a useful epidemiologic tool to evaluate temporal changes in ROP epidemiology.

Research Design & Methods: The study employed a narrative and critical literature review and developed a conceptual framework based on prior literature. We used a line of deductive reasoning in formulating our theoretical framework to make the study’s overall structure rational and productive. Therefore, this article should be viewed as a conceptual article that highlights the controversies and threats of GAI in management and economics, with ChatGPT as a case study. Findings: Based on the conducted deep and extensive query of academic literature on the subject as well as professional press and Internet portals, we identified various controversies, threats, defects, and disadvantages of GAI, in particular ChatGPT. Next, we grouped the identified threats into clusters to summarize the seven main threats we see. In our opinion they are as follows: (i) no regulation of the AI market and urgent need for regulation, (ii) poor quality, lack of quality control, disinformation, deepfake content, algorithmic bias, (iii) automationspurred job losses, (iv) personal data violation, social surveillance, and privacy violation, (v) social manipulation, weakening ethics and goodwill, (vi) widening socio-economic inequalities, and (vii) AI technostress. Implications & Recommendations: It is important to regulate the AI/GAI market. Advocating for the regulation of the AI market is crucial to ensure a level playing field, promote fair competition, protect intellectual property rights and privacy, and prevent potential geopolitical risks. The changing job market requires workers to continuously acquire new (digital) skills through education and retraining. As the training of AI systems becomes a prominent job category, it is important to adapt and take advantage of new opportunities. To mitigate the risks related to personal data violation, social surveillance, and privacy violation, GAI developers must prioritize ethical considerations and work to develop systems that prioritize user privacy and security. To avoid social manipulation and weaken ethics and goodwill, it is important to implement responsible AI practices and ethical guidelines: transparency in data usage, bias mitigation techniques, and monitoring of generated content for harmful or misleading information. Contribution & Value Added: This article may aid in bringing attention to the significance of resolving the ethical and legal considerations that arise from the use of GAI and ChatGPT by drawing attention to the controversies and hazards associated with these technologies. © 2023, Cracow University of Economics.

It is a master plan that builds upon the EU AI High-Level Expert Group guidelines. This article reviews the masterplan, from a culture cycle perspective, to reflect on its potential clashes with current societal, technical, and methodological constraints. We identify two main obstacles in the implementation of this plan: (i) the lack of a coherent EU vision to drive future decision-making processes at state and local levels and (ii) the lack of methods to support a sustainable diffusion of AI in our society. The lack of a coherent vision stems from not considering societal differences across the EU member states. We suggest that these differences may lead to a fractured market and an AI crisis in which different members of the EU will adopt nation-centric strategies to exploit AI, thus preventing the development of a frictionless market as envisaged by the EU. Moreover, the Commission aims at changing the AI development culture proposing a human-centred and safety-first perspective that is not supported by methodological advancements, thus taking the risks of unforeseen social and societal impacts of AI. We discuss potential societal, technical, and methodological gaps that should be filled to avoid the risks of developing AI systems at the expense of society. Our analysis results in the recommendation that the EU regulators and policymakers consider how to complement the EC programme with rules and compensatory mechanisms to avoid market fragmentation due to local and global ambitions. Moreover, regulators should go beyond the human-centred approach establishing a research agenda seeking answers to the technical and methodological open questions regarding the development and assessment of human-AI co-action aiming for a sustainable AI diffusion in the society. © 2022, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85123490849"

While conventional approaches for assessing airspace complexity certainly exist, these methods fail to capture true airspace capacity, since they fail to address several important variables (such as weather). Meanwhile, existing AI-based decision-support systems evince opacity and inexplicability, and this restricts their practical application. With these challenges in mind, the authors propose a tailored solution to the needs of demand and capacity management (DCM) services. This solution, by deploying a synthesized fuzzy rule-based model and deep learning will address the trade-off between explicability and performance. In doing so, it will generate an intelligent system that will be explicable and reasonably comprehensible. The results show that this advisory system will be able to indicate the most appropriate regions for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs) operation, and it will also increase UTM airspace availability by more than 23%. Moreover, the proposed system demonstrates a maximum capacity gain of 65% and a minimum safety gain of 35%, while possessing an explainability attribute of 70%. This will assist UTM authorities through more effective airspace capacity estimation and the formulation of new operational regulations and performance requirements. © 2023 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85160249932"

These models have clearly generated great enthusiasm within the scientific community, and different applications of these 3D predictions are regularly described in scientific articles, demonstrating the impact of these high-quality models. Despite the acknowledged high accuracy of these models in general, it seems important to make users of these models aware of the wealth of information they offer and to encourage them to make the best use of them. Here, we focus on the impact of these models in a specific application by structural biologists using X-ray crystallography. We propose guidelines to prepare models to be used for molecular replacement trials to solve the phase problem. We also encourage colleagues to share as much detail as possible about how they use these models in their research, where the models did not yield correct molecular replacement solutions, and how these predictions fit with their experimental 3D structure.

The COVID-19 pandemic further revealed critical gaps in existing mental health services as factors such as job losses and corresponding financial issues, prolonged physical illness and death, and physical isolation led to a sharp rise in mental health conditions [2]. As such, there is increasing interest in the viability and desirability of digital mental health applications. While these dedicated applications vary widely, from platforms that connect users with healthcare professionals to diagnostic tools to self-assessments, this article specifically explores the implications of digital mental health applications in the form of chatbots [3]. Chatbots can be text based or voice enabled and may be rule based (i.e., linguistics based) or based on machine learning (ML). They can utilize the power of conversational agents well-suited to task-oriented interactions, like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, or Google Assistant.

Artificial intelligence (AI) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has been explored for diagnosing scaphoid fractures in X-rays. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the use of AI for detecting scaphoid fractures on X-rays and analyze its accuracy and usefulness. Materials and methods: This study followed the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and PRISMA-Diagnostic Test Accuracy. A literature search was conducted in the PubMed database for original articles published until July 2023. The risk of bias and applicability were evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool. A bivariate diagnostic random-effects meta-analysis was conducted, and the results were analyzed using the Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic (SROC) curve. Results: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria and were all retrospective. The AI’s diagnostic performance for detecting scaphoid fractures ranged from AUC 0.77 to 0.96. Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 3373 images. The meta-analysis pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.80 and 0.89, respectively. The meta-analysis overall AUC was 0.88. The QUADAS-2 tool found high risk of bias and concerns about applicability in 9 out of 10 studies. Conclusions: The current results of AI’s diagnostic performance for detecting scaphoid fractures in X-rays show promise. The results show high overall sensitivity and specificity and a high SROC result. Further research is needed to compare AI’s diagnostic performance to human diagnostic performance in a clinical setting. Clinical relevance statement: Scaphoid fractures are prone to be missed secondary to assessment with a low sensitivity modality and a high occult fracture rate. AI systems can be beneficial for clinicians and radiologists to facilitate early diagnosis, and avoid missed injuries. Key Points: • Scaphoid fractures are common and some can be easily missed in X-rays. • Artificial intelligence (AI) systems demonstrate high diagnostic performance for the diagnosis of scaphoid fractures in X-rays. • AI systems can be beneficial in diagnosing both obvious and occult scaphoid fractures. © 2023, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85179747719"

Partial automation of nAMD treatment decisions could reduce demands on clinician time. Established artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled retinal imaging analysis tools, could be applied to this use-case, but are not yet validated for it. A primary qualitative investigation of stakeholder perceptions of such an AI-enabled decision tool is also absent. This multi-methods study aims to establish the safety and efficacy of an AI-enabled decision tool for nAMD treatment decisions and understand where on the clinical pathway it could sit and what factors are likely to influence its implementation. Methods and analysis Single-centre retrospective imaging and clinical data will be collected from nAMD clinic visits at a National Health Service (NHS) teaching hospital ophthalmology service, including judgements of nAMD disease stability or activity made in real-world consultant-led-care. Dataset size will be set by a power calculation using the first 127 randomly sampled eligible clinic visits. An AI-enabled retinal segmentation tool and a rule-based decision tree will independently analyse imaging data to report nAMD stability or activity for each of these clinic visits. Independently, an external reading centre will receive both clinical and imaging data to generate an enhanced reference standard for each clinic visit. The non-inferiority of the relative negative predictive value of AI-enabled reports on disease activity relative to consultant-led-care judgements will then be tested. In parallel, approximately 40 semi-structured interviews will be conducted with key nAMD service stakeholders, including patients. Transcripts will be coded using a theoretical framework and thematic analysis will follow.

Nonetheless, concerns are raised about the validity of the contracts concluded by autonomous machines and, subsequently, about the contractual responsibility in case of non-performance. Various theories have already been expounded in legal doctrine, with the view to tackling thereon. Some of them suggest that autonomous AI systems are mere communication tools or agents that render their user liable, whilst other legal scholars suggest that autonomous AI systems themselves—not their user—should be held liable. After presenting the arguments of these theories, the chapter concludes that the legal community should absolutely accept the validity of the contracts concluded by intelligent agents, considering their users legally bound to their performance. Users’ liability could be based on the theory of de facto contracts (faktische Verträge) or, alternatively, on the doctrine of reliance liability (Vertrauenshaftung). In both cases, users’ right to invalidate the contract in case of mistake must be guaranteed and the mistake shall be assigned to the intelligent agent. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","2-s2.0-85178872158"

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for the quality classification of the recorded images. After quality control, the component is sorted automatically in different bins depending on the quality control result. The trained CNN models achieve up to 98.7% accuracy on the test data. The classification performance of the CNN is compared with that of a rule-based approach. Additionally, the trained classification model is interpreted by an explainable AI method to make it comprehensible for humans and reassure them about its trustworthiness.

It is of no exception in the area of prognostics and health management (PHM) where the capacity of AI has been highlighted through numerous studies. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of AI-based solutions in engineering PHM. This review serves as a guideline for researchers and practitioners with varying levels of experience seeking to broaden their know-how about AI-based PHM. Specifically, we provide both a broad quantitative analysis and a comprehensive qualitative examination of the roles of AI in PHM. The quantitative analysis offers an insight into the research community’s interest in AI-based approaches, focusing on the evolution of research trends and their developments in different PHM application areas. The qualitative survey gives a complete picture on the employment of AI in each stage of the PHM process, from data preparation to decision support. Based on the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods, we derive a general guideline for choosing proper techniques for each specific PHM task, aiming to level up maintenance practitioners’ efficiency in implementing PHM solutions. Finally, the review discusses challenges and future research directions in the development of autonomous intelligent PHM solutions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","2-s2.0-85137841434"

Furthermore, the manner in which consumers interact directly with health care AI is reshaping traditional physician-patient relationships. However, the academic community lacks a systematic comprehension of the research overview for such apps. Objective: This paper systematically delineated and analyzed the characteristics of included studies, identified existing barriers and design recommendations for DTC health care AI apps mentioned in the literature and also provided a reference for future design and development. Methods: This scoping review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines and was conducted according to Arksey and O’Malley’s 5-stage framework. Peer-reviewed papers on DTC health care AI apps published until March 27, 2023, in Web of Science, Scopus, the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Google Scholar were included. The papers were analyzed using Braun and Clarke’s reflective thematic analysis approach. Results: Of the 2898 papers retrieved, 32 (1.1%) covering this emerging field were included. The included papers were recently published (2018-2023), and most (23/32, 72%) were from developed countries. The medical field was mostly general practice (8/32, 25%). In terms of users and functionalities, some apps were designed solely for single-consumer groups (24/32, 75%), offering disease diagnosis (14/32, 44%), health self-management (8/32, 25%), and health care information inquiry (4/32, 13%). Other apps connected to physicians (5/32, 16%), family members (1/32, 3%), nursing staff (1/32, 3%), and health care departments (2/32, 6%), generally to alert these groups to abnormal conditions of consumer users. In addition, 8 barriers and 6 design recommendations related to DTC health care AI apps were identified. Some more subtle obstacles that are particularly worth noting and corresponding design recommendations in consumer-facing health care AI systems, including enhancing human-centered explainability, establishing calibrated trust and addressing overtrust, demonstrating empathy in AI, improving the specialization of consumer-grade products, and expanding the diversity of the test population, were further discussed. Conclusions: The booming DTC health care AI apps present both risks and opportunities, which highlights the need to explore their current status. This paper systematically summarized and sorted the characteristics of the included studies, identified existing barriers faced by, and made future design recommendations for such apps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically summarize and categorize academic research on these apps. Future studies conducting the design and development of such systems could refer to the results of this study, which is crucial to improve the health care services provided by DTC health care AI apps. © Xin He, Xi Zheng, Huiyuan Ding.

Since the success of AI is to be measured ultimately in terms of how it benefits human beings, and that the data driving the deep learning-based edge AI algorithms are intricately and intimately tied to humans, it is important to look at these AI technologies through a human-centric lens. However, despite the significant impact of AI design on human interests, the security and trustworthiness of edge AI applications are not foolproof and ethicalneither foolproof nor ethical; Moreover, social norms are often ignored duringin the design, implementation, and deployment of edge AI systems. In this paper, we make the following two contributions: Firstly, we analyze the application of edge AI through a human-centric perspective. More specifically, we present a pipeline to develop human-centric embedded machine learning (HC-EML) applications leveraging a generic human-centric AI (HCAI) framework. Alongside, we also analyzediscuss the privacy, trustworthiness, robustness, and security aspects of HC-EML applications with an insider look at their challenges and possible solutions along the way. Secondly, to illustrate the gravity of these issues, we present a case study on the task of human facial emotion recognition (FER) based on AffectNet dataset, where we analyze the effects of widely used input quantization on the security, robustness, fairness, and trustworthiness of an EML model. We find that input quantization partially degrades the efficacy of adversarial and backdoor attacks at the cost of a slight decrease in accuracy over clean inputs. By analyzing the explanations generated by SHAP, we identify that the decision of a FER model is largely influenced by features such as eyes, alar crease, lips, and jaws. Additionally, we note that input quantization is notably biased against the dark skin faces, and hypothesize that low-contrast features of dark skin faces may be responsible for the observed trends. We conclude with precautionary remarks and guidelines for future researchers. © 2022 The Author(s)","2-s2.0-85144401760"

In this paper, we contribute by performing a qualitative and quantitative analysis of different requirement management tools and their performance in managing AI-related requirements effectively. Through a rigorous analysis performed by a consortium formed by different industry and academic partners, we evaluate the suitability of five different requirement management tools. Our results indicate that while several tools are available for managing requirements, it is currently challenging to find a tool that can manage AI requirements mainly because tools do not comply with the required aspects imposed by regulatory entities.

The researchers extracted key terms from these guidelines and categorized them based on their frequency across the six sources to get a deeper understanding of their content and identify central themes and topics across each guideline. In doing so, the paper was able to identify ethical considerations and challenges of implementing AI in the Philippine context, including data collection, use and sharing, and AI development. The insights from the literature and document reviews and the analysis of the extracted key terms were used to craft considerations in formulating AI policy for the Philippines. These include (1) defining ethical principles and values in developing and implementing AI, (2) establishing mechanisms for ensuring fairness and preventing bias, (3) implementing mechanisms to ensure security and mitigating risks in AI systems, and (4) assessing potential impacts on AI technologies. Overall, the study uncovered that existing guidelines and legal frameworks on AI ethics seem to have put less emphasis on ethics and fairness. This underpins the need for the PH to ensure that its localized AI ethics policy is clear about its definition of what is ethical and fair use of AI across sectors, industries., demographics, and contexts.  © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85180154518"

This issue has led to eXplainable AI (XAI) development, focusing on constructing explanations for AI systems. However, the evaluation of these explanations lacks a standardized user-centric approach. This research proposes an evaluation framework for XAI methods to address this gap. The project involves four stages: conducting a systematic review of current evaluation methods, assessing the appropriateness of automatic evaluation of explanations, and conducting user studies to gauge the framework's effectiveness in capturing the user experience complexity. The desired outcome is a user-centric evaluation framework and guidelines, enhancing the scalability of XAI research and fostering confidence in adopting AI systems in the healthcare domain. © 2023 CEUR-WS.

However, AI systems can have discriminatory effects when used for decision-making. To illustrate, an AI system could reject applications of people with a certain ethnicity, while the organisation did not plan such ethnicity discrimination. But in Europe, an organisation runs into a problem when it wants to assess whether its AI system accidentally discriminates based on ethnicity: the organisation may not know the applicants’ ethnicity. In principle, the GDPR bans the use of certain ‘special categories of data’ (sometimes called ‘sensitive data’), which include data on ethnicity, religion, and sexual preference. The proposal for an AI Act of the European Commission includes a provision that would enable organisations to use special categories of data for auditing their AI systems. This paper asks whether the GDPR's rules on special categories of personal data hinder the prevention of AI-driven discrimination. We argue that the GDPR does prohibit such use of special category data in many circumstances. We also map out the arguments for and against creating an exception to the GDPR's ban on using special categories of personal data, to enable preventing discrimination by AI systems. The paper discusses European law, but the paper can be relevant outside Europe too, as many policymakers in the world grapple with the tension between privacy and non-discrimination policy. © 2022","2-s2.0-85142768621"

However, the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the breast cancer screening process has not yet been fully elucidated in terms of potential workload reduction. We aim to assess if AI-based triaging of breast cancer screening mammograms could reduce the radiologist's workload with non-inferior sensitivity. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for studies that evaluated AI algorithms on computer-aided triage of breast cancer screening mammograms. We extracted data from homogenous studies and performed a proportion meta-analysis with a random-effects model to examine the radiologist's workload reduction (proportion of low-risk mammograms that could be theoretically ruled out from human's assessment) and the software's sensitivity to breast cancer detection. Results: Thirteen studies were selected for full review, and three studies that used the same commercially available DL algorithm were included in the meta-analysis. In the 156,852 examinations included, the threshold of 7 was identified as optimal. With these parameters, radiologist workload decreased by 68.3% (95%CI 0.655–0.711, I² = 98.76%, p < 0.001), while achieving a sensitivity of 93.1% (95%CI 0.882–0.979, I² = 83.86%, p = 0.002) and a specificity of 68.7% (95% CI 0.684–0.723, I² = 97.5%, p < 0.01).

However, their importance in improving model usage and understanding has not been extensively studied. Hence, we consider a comorbidity risk prediction scenario and focus on contexts regarding the patients’ clinical state, AI predictions about their risk of complications, and algorithmic explanations supporting the predictions. We explore how relevant information for such dimensions can be extracted from Medical guidelines to answer typical questions from clinical practitioners. We identify this as a question answering (QA) task and employ several state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLM) to present contexts around risk prediction model inferences and evaluate their acceptability. Finally, we study the benefits of contextual explanations by building an end-to-end AI pipeline including data cohorting, AI risk modeling, post-hoc model explanations, and prototyped a visual dashboard to present the combined insights from different context dimensions and data sources, while predicting and identifying the drivers of risk of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) - a common type-2 diabetes (T2DM) comorbidity. All of these steps were performed in deep engagement with medical experts, including a final evaluation of the dashboard results by an expert medical panel. We show that LLMs, in particular BERT and SciBERT, can be readily deployed to extract some relevant explanations to support clinical usage. To understand the value-add of the contextual explanations, the expert panel evaluated these regarding actionable insights in the relevant clinical setting. Overall, our paper is one of the first end-to-end analyses identifying the feasibility and benefits of contextual explanations in a real-world clinical use case.

The CT interface made contact with patients via their mobile phone, following a locally produced script to obtain information recording physical condition, wellness and support. The care robot has engaged over 6323 patients between 2 September to 14 December 2021. The AI-assisted phone calls effectively identified the patients requiring further support, saved clinician time by monitoring less ailing patients remotely, and enabled them to spend more time on critically ill patients, thus ensuring that service and supply resources could be directed to those at greatest need.

The current scenario of assigning clinical codes is a manual process which is very expensive, time-consuming and error prone. In recent years, many researchers have studied the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP), related machine learning and deep learning methods and techniques to resolve the problem of manual coding of clinical narratives and to assist human coders to assign clinical codes more accurately and efficiently. The main objective of this systematic literature review is to provide a comprehensive overview of automated clinical coding systems that utilise appropriate NLP, machine learning and deep learning methods and techniques to assign the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes to discharge summaries. We have followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and conducted a comprehensive search of publications from January, 2010 to December 2021 in four high quality academic databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, and the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Anthology. We reviewed 6128 publications; 42 met the inclusion criteria. This review identified: 6 datasets having discharge summaries (2 publicly available, 4 acquired from hospitals); 14 NLP techniques along with some other data extraction processes, different feature extraction and embedding techniques. The review also shows that there is a significant increase in the use of deep learning models compared to machine learning. To measure the performance of classification methods, different evaluation metrics are used. Efforts are still required to improve ICD code prediction accuracy, availability of large-scale de-identified clinical corpora with the latest version of the classification system.

From healthcare decision-making to social media censoring, these agents face problems, and make decisions with ethical and societal implications. Ethical behaviour is a critical characteristic that we would like in a human-centric AI. A common observation in human-centric industries, like the service industry and healthcare, is that their professionals tend to break rules, if necessary, for pro-social reasons. This behaviour among humans is defined as pro-social rule breaking. To make AI agents more human-centric, we argue that there is a need for a mechanism that helps AI agents identify when to break rules set by their designers. To understand when AI agents need to break rules, we examine the conditions under which humans break rules for pro-social reasons. In this paper, we present a study that introduces a ‘vaccination strategy dilemma’ to human participants and analyzes their response. In this dilemma, one needs to decide whether they would distribute COVID-19 vaccines only to members of a high-risk group (follow the enforced rule) or, in selected cases, administer the vaccine to a few social influencers (break the rule), which might yield an overall greater benefit to society. The results of the empirical study suggest a relationship between stakeholder utilities and pro-social rule breaking (PSRB), which neither deontological nor utilitarian ethics completely explain. Finally, the paper discusses the design characteristics of an ethical agent capable of PSRB and the future research directions on PSRB in the AI realm. We hope that this will inform the design of future AI agents, and their decision-making behaviour. © 2022, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85130510136"

Due to the difficulty of quantifying PD in the past, doctors have tended to focus on some signs while ignoring others, primarily relying on an intuitive assessment scale because of the disease’s characteristics, which include loss of motor control and speech that can be utilized to detect and diagnose this disease. It is an illness that impacts both motion and non-motion functions. It takes years to develop and has a wide range of clinical symptoms and prognoses. Parkinson’s patients commonly display non-motor symptoms such as sleep problems, neurocognitive ailments, and cognitive impairment long before the diagnosis, even though scientists have been working to develop designs for diagnosing and categorizing the disease, only noticeable defects such as movement patterns, speech, or writing skills are offered in this paper. This article provides a thorough analysis of several AI-based ML and DL techniques used to diagnose PD and their influence on developing additional research directions. It follows the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR).

However, these benefits are often lost over time, as the system implementation evolves and the original models are not updated. Reverse engineering methods and tools could help to keep models and implementation code in sync; however, automatically reverse-engineered models are typically not abstract and contain extensive information that prevents understanding. Recent advances in AI-based content generation make it likely that we will soon see reverse engineering tools with support for human-grade abstraction. To inform the design and validation of such tools, we need a principled understanding of what manual abstraction is, a question that has received little attention in the literature so far.Towards this goal, in this paper, we present a multiple-case study of model-To-code differences, investigating five substantial open-source software projects retrieved via repository mining. To explore characteristics of model-To-code differences, we, all in all, manually matched 466 classes, 1352 attributes, and 2634 operations from source code to 338 model elements (classes, attributes, operations, and relationships). These mappings precisely capture the differences between a provided class diagram design and implementation codebase. Studying all differences in detail allowed us to derive a taxonomy of difference types and to provide a sorted list of cases corresponding to the identified types of differences. As we discuss, our contributions pave the way for improved reverse engineering methods and tools, new mapping rules for model-To-code consistency checks, and guidelines for avoiding over-Abstraction and over-specification during design.  © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85182331824"

Modern monitoring tools rely on AI-empowered data analytics for detection, root cause analysis, and rapid resolution of performance degradation. However, the successful adoption of AI solutions is anchored on trust. System administrators will not unthinkingly follow the recommendations without sufficient interpretability of solutions. Explainable AI is gaining popularity by enabling improved confidence and trust in intelligent solutions. For many industrial applications, explainable models with moderate accuracy are preferable to highly precise black-box ones. This paper shows the benefits of rule-induction classification methods, particularly RIPPER, for the root cause analysis of performance degradations. RIPPER reveals the causes of problems in a set of rules system administrators can use in remediation processes. Native cloud applications are based on the microservices architecture to consume the benefits of distributed computing. Monitoring such applications can be accomplished via distributed tracing, which inspects the passage of requests through different microservices. We discuss the application of rule-learning approaches to trace traffic passing through a malfunctioning microservice for the explanations of the problem. Experiments performed on datasets from cloud environments proved the applicability of such approaches and unveiled the benefits. © 2023, IICM. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-85181214026"

Design/methodology/approach: After a review of the literature, this paper presents the main lines by which SAT stands out from current methods, namely, a four-bubble approach and a mix of qualitative and quantitative techniques that offer assessments that look at technology as a socio-technical system. Each bubble determines the social variability of a cluster of values: User-Experience Acceptance, Social Disruptiveness, Value Impact and Trust. Findings: The methodology is still in development, requiring further developments, specifications and validation. Accordingly, the findings of this paper refer to the realm of the research discussion, that is, highlighting the importance of preventively assessing and forecasting the acceptance of technology and building the best design strategies to boost sustainable and ethical technology adoption. Social implications: Once SAT method will be validated, it could constitute a useful tool, with societal implications, for helping users, markets and institutions to appraise and determine the co-implications of technology and socio-cultural contexts. Originality/value: New AI applications flood today’s users and markets, often without a clear understanding of risks and impacts. In the European context, regulations (EU AI Act) and rules (EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy) try to fill this normative gap. The SAT method seeks to integrate the risk-based assessment of AI with an assessment of the perceptive-psychological and socio-behavioural aspects of its social acceptability. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2-s2.0-85141993879"

Artificial Intelligence technologies also encompass a series of possibilities for space sustainability. We describe the legal issues brought by this technology, and then focus specifically on AI systems for space operations, which entail questions about how these interact with existing legal concepts and technical standards. We address the role of AI for space sustainability, especially in relation to how it can support the implementation of the 2019 UNCOPUOS Guidelines for the Long-term Sustainability of Space Activities. We also discuss how space law is relevant and applicable to AI use in the context of sustainable space operations, including autonomous action to avoid collisions in orbit and space traffic management to limit orbital congestion. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Matteo Madi and Olga Sokolova; individual chapters, the contributors.","2-s2.0-85180042690"

Although the vast majority of incidental pulmonary nodules are benign, many early lung carcinomas could be diagnosed with consistent follow-up. However, for a variety of reasons, the existing recommendations are often not implemented correctly. Therefore, potential for improvement with respect to competence, communication, structure, and process is described. Methods  This article presents the recommendations for incidental pulmonary nodules from the current S3 guideline for lung cancer (July 2023). The internationally established recommendations (BTS guidelines and Fleischner criteria) are compared and further studies on optimized management were included after a systematic literature search in PubMed. Results and Conclusion  In particular, AI-based software solutions are promising, as they can be used in a support capacity on several levels at once and can lead to simpler and more automated management. However, to be applicable in routine clinical practice, software must fit well into the radiology workflow and be integrated. In addition, Lung Nodule Management programs or clinics that follow a high-quality procedure for patients with incidental lung nodules or nodules detected by screening have been established in the USA. Similar structures might also be implemented in Germany in a future screening program in which patients with incidental pulmonary nodules could be included. Key Points:   Incidental pulmonary nodules are common but are often not adequately managed The updated S3 guideline for lung cancer now includes recommendations for incidental pulmonary nodules Competence, communication, structure, and process levels offer significant potential for improvement Citation Format Glandorf J, Vogel-Claussen J,.

It induces economic, ecologic, and social implications. Current advanced supply and demand planning frameworks consider waste as an expected lost value in a profit-seeking trade-off. Consequently, existing initiatives for food re-distribution tackle the problem at the end of the supply chain, i.e., at the retailer stage. Advanced forecasting is foreseen as a facilitator of planning towards food waste prevention. However, companies in food production and retail seldomly utilize advanced forecasting methods, i.e., artificial intelligence. Deterrents for inadaptability rank from the differentiation between the role of pure data driven reliance and the human factor. Furthermore, no remarkable endeavor has so far combined heterogeneous external data integration with advanced forecasting techniques for food waste reduction. This paper proposes an architecture for a collaborative digital demand and supply matching platform for perishable food supply chains. Focus lies in the integration of heterogeneous big data (i.e., mobile transaction data and weather data) with AI-based forecasting methods. Building on the Design Science Research methodology, problems and requirements from the perishable food industry form the base for the platform architecture as the core artifact. The validation of the proposed architecture is undertaken by a panel of selected business experts from food retail and wholesale. The designed platform architecture consists of the core modules “data layer”, “logic layer”, “interaction layer”, and “data visualization”, and includes governance rules for sensible knowledge protection and data security. The present work contributes to the research area of food waste prevention by combining collaborative supply chain management approaches with advanced data-driven technologies including artificial intelligence and heterogeneous big data integration. Further research will extend this study by a use-case implementation. © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, recent research has looked into an AI-based analysis of identifiers, for which large-scale language models appear to offer great potential. Based on tokens' probabilities, such models can suggest identifiers that are likely to appear in a given context. While current research has used language models to predict the most likely identifier names, studies on assessing the quality of given identifiers are scarce. To this end, we explore adherence to identifier naming guidelines as a proxy for identifier quality and propose and evaluate two unsupervised approaches for spotting violations: First, a generative approach, which uses the probability distribution of the language model directly without fine-tuning. Second, a discriminative method, which fine-tunes the model's encoder to discriminate between original identifiers and similar drop-in replacements suggested by a weak AI. We demonstrate that the proposed approaches can successfully detect violations of common guidelines for identifier naming. To do so, we have developed a dataset built on widely accepted identifier naming guidelines. The manually annotated dataset contains more than 6000 dense annotations of identifiers for 28 common guidelines. Using the data, we show that the generative approach achieves the best results, but that the particular masking strategy and scoring method matter substantially. Also, we demonstrate our approach to outperform other recent code transformers. In a per-guideline analysis, we highlight the potential and limitations of language models, and provide a blue-print for training and evaluating their ability to identify bad identifier names in source code. We make our dataset and models' implementation publicly available to encourage future research on AI-based identifier quality assessment.  © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85182729792"

Lately, artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been utilized in the spectrum of these advancements. This has led to a new form of arms race and human rights abuses whilst resisting any attempt to conclude a binding regulation in developing or using AI technology, and although AI has been a frontline issue in many disciplines from various angles, it nonetheless has not been as much in the legal profession, and specifically in international law. The unprecedented AI technology changes, despite the many advantages, alarms the need to continuously explore its impact within various aspects of international law. The absence of a conclusive international threshold for AI development and use might cause hindering international relations if international law orthodoxies in humanitarian law and human rights become improperly effected. Accordingly, this paper examines whether there is a need to develop the existing international legal order, whether directly or indirectly, and suggest establishing an IGO entity with a mandate to reshape rules and embedded values in the face of a rapid AI technological advancement. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Librello, Switzerland.","2-s2.0-85178886063"

However, the black-box characteristic of AI interrupts its application in NPPs due to the lack of transparency, explainability, and reliability of AI. In this paper, a rule extraction method was used to secure transparency, explainability, and reliability of the operator support system to support operators in abnormal situations of NPPs. In NPPs, many abnormal operating procedures are prepared to mitigate abnormal situations, but a decision-making process is involved in selecting an appropriate procedure among them. The system in this paper was developed using the deep neural network (DNN) method as a procedure recommendation system to support such a decision-making process, and data required for developing the DNN model was collected by simulating abnormal situations in NPPs using the compact nuclear simulator. The optimization of the DNN model was achieved using a combination of grid search and early stopping methods. The efficient clause-wise rule extraction method was applied to extract the rules of the DNN model, and the extracted rules are used to construct a rule-based system comprising a set of single rules in the form of “IF…THEN”. The rule-based system helps understand the prediction method of the model by extracting understandable rules and decision criteria. The accuracy and fidelity are used as evaluation metrics to measure the ability of the extracted rule-based system to describe the DNN model. As a result, the application of the rule extraction method can provide additional insights into the decision-making process of AI-based operator support systems in NPPs. © 2023 American Nuclear Society, Incorporated.","2-s2.0-85183315454"

It delves into specific aspects, including chatbots, Chat GPT, issues related to chat-based plagiarism, educational simulations, and the impact of AI on the labor market. Methods: In our study ""The legal framework for the use of artificial intelligence in educational activities"", we use a variety of study methods to consider this issue from different approaches and take into account the key aspects that affect the effective and ethical use of artificial intelligence in education. Starting with a documentary analysis, we study the current legal norms regulating the use of artificial intelligence in the educational sphere. By researching the laws of different countries, we identify the main rules and restrictions that relate to ownership of works, data privacy, ethical standards and liability Results: The article addresses the challenge of chat-based plagiarism and the resulting implications for students and educators. It emphasizes the importance of exercising caution when using information to prevent instances of plagiarism. The increasing prevalence of chatbots and GPT models may tempt students to submit work generated by these systems as their own, yet it's noteworthy that AI tools can also be harnessed for plagiarism detection, ultimately promoting academic integrity. Furthermore, the application of machine learning and data analysis is considered in creating personalized learning programs that cater to each student's unique needs, abilities, and interests, thereby enhancing the efficacy of learning and knowledge retention. Conclusion: Artificial intelligence stands as a highly relevant topic in contemporary science, with wide-ranging implications across various aspects of human activities, most notably in the field of education. The integration of artificial intelligence into educational practices holds the promise of enhancing the quality, accessibility, and overall effectiveness of education. However, this progress raises the pressing issue of establishing a legal framework for its application in educational settings. The article scrutinizes the diversity of chatbots employed within the realm of education and assesses their functionalities. Chatbots have the potential to serve students by providing access to information and responses to inquiries at any time, enhancing the educational experience.The effectiveness of integrating Chat GPT into educational processes is evaluated, exploring its potential utility for both students and educators when working with textual materials. The article also explores the implementation of artificial intelligence in the form of learning simulations. It discusses how this tool can assist educators in enhancing the quality of instruction and fostering student development.

However, defining these thresholds in an entirely discrete manner is challenging, despite their major importance. Conversely, triggering an alarm without sufficient justification can be costly for the state and unnecessarily disrupt the lives of citizens. In this regard, employing a more flexible approach, such as fuzzy logic, in the context of artificial intelligence empowerment of the whole process, can provide rules to mitigate the discreteness of alarm thresholds. Failing to raise an alarm, when necessary, can result in significant human and property losses. In this article, we present a new approach that utilises fuzzy logic to classify danger thresholds in a smoother and more effective manner for the civil protection. The paper offers valuable insights into the practical implementation of Fuzzy Logic and the entire life cycle of the proposed Fuzzy logic-based approach. This approach is designed to be iterative, involving key stakeholders to ensure the validity and reliability of the results. © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85182028247"

This paper explores a hybrid crowd-AI approach to develop white-box ML models associated with human-interpretable symbolic rules. The key idea of the proposed method is to discover human-interpretable latent features from trained neural networks by leveraging human abductive reasoning. The proposed method automatically generates crowdsourcing tasks that display subsets of images corresponding to each latent feature and ask crowd workers to provide the semantics of the features in natural language. The obtained semantics allow us to use the latent features as human-interpretable predicates that form symbolic rules to define target classes.

The development of large-scale language models has facilitated the progress of artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of solving math word problems and proving theorems. These models have achieved remarkable results across various geometry problem datasets, attracting significant attention in natural language processing community. However, it remains a challenge to effectively evaluate the logical correctness in the process of solution steps answered by the model due to the diversity of solution approaches. Therefore, we propose a powerful approach that can check the logical sufficiency of the solving process of given geometry problems step by step with symbolic computation and logical reasoning, called Sufficient Geometry problem solution checking (Suffi-GPSC). Suffi-GPSC divides the tasks into two categories, one focuses on equation expressions and checks whether the target equations are true with symbolic computation under the preconditions that contain a large number of equations. The other focuses on geometric relationships and checks whether the goal relation can be deduced within limited steps with logical reasoning by considering known facts as conditions and axiomatic knowledge as conditional rules. Inspired by the mainstream, a theorem predictor based on transfer text-to-text transformer(T5) has been designed to generate the theorem sequences for a more efficient and rational reasoning process. Extensive experiments on the Geometry3K dataset demonstrate that Suffi-GPSC achieves remarkable improvements.  © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85184655376"

However, a more recent approach utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) enables automated BA estimation based on the G&P atlas. Nevertheless, AI-based methods encounter limitations when dealing with images that deviate from the standard hand and wrist projections. Generally, the extent to which BA, as determined by the G&P atlas, corresponds to the chronological age (CA) of a contemporary German population remains a subject of continued discourse. This study aims to address two main objectives. Firstly, it seeks to investigate whether the G&P atlas, as applied by the AI software, is still relevant for healthy children in Germany today. Secondly, the study aims to assess the performance of the AI software in handling non-strict posterior-anterior (p. a.) projections of the hand and wrist. Materials and Methods  The AI software retrospectively estimated the BA in children who had undergone radiographs of a single hand using posterior-anterior and oblique planes. The primary purpose was to rule out any osseous injuries. The prediction error of BA in relation to CA was calculated for each plane and between the two planes. Results  A total of 1253 patients (aged 3 to 16 years, median age10.8 years, 55.7 % male) were included in the study. The average error of BA in posterior-anterior projections compared to CA was 3.0 (± 13.7) months for boys and 1.7 (± 13.7) months for girls. Interestingly, the deviation from CA tended to be even slightly lower in oblique projections than in posterior-anterior projections. The mean error in the posterior-anterior projection plane was 2.5 (± 13.7) months, while in the oblique plane it was 1.8 (± 13.9) months (p = 0.01). Conclusion  The AI software for BA generally corresponds to the age of the contemporary German population under study, although there is a noticeable prediction error, particularly in younger children. Notably, the software demonstrates robust performance in oblique projections. Key Points:   Bone age, as determined by artificial intelligence, aligns with the chronological age of the contemporary German cohort under study. As determined by artificial intelligence, bone age is remarkably robust, even when utilizing oblique X-ray projections. © 2023 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-85179791113"

AI systems tested and validated on poor-quality datasets can produce inaccurate, erroneous, skewed, or harmful outcomes (actions, behaviors, or decisions), with far-reaching effects on individuals' rights and freedoms. Appropriate data governance for AI development poses manifold regulatory challenges, especially regarding personal data protection. An area of concern is compliance with rules for lawful collection and processing of personal data, which implies, inter alia, that using databases for AI design and development should be based on a clear and precise legal ground: the prior consent of the data subject or another specific valid legal basis. Faced with this challenge, the European Union's personal data protection legal framework does not provide a preferred, one-size-fits-all answer, and the best option will depend on the circumstances of each case. Although there is no hierarchy among the different legal bases for data processing, in doubtful cases, consent is generally understood by data controllers as a preferred or default choice for lawful data processing. Notwithstanding this perception, obtaining data subjects' consent is not without drawbacks for AI developers or AI-data controllers, as they must meet (and demonstrate) various requirements for the validity of consent. As a result, data subjects' consent could not be a suitable and realistic option to serve AI development purposes. In view of this, it is necessary to explore the possibility of basing this type of personal data processing on lawful grounds other than the data subject's consent, specifically, the legitimate interest of the data controller or third parties. Given its features, legitimate interests could help to meet the challenge of quality, quantity, and relevance of data curation for AI training. The aim of this article is to provide an initial conceptual approach to support the debate about data governance for AI development in the European Union (EU), as well as in non-EU jurisdictions with European-like data protection laws. Based on the rules set by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), this paper starts by referring to the relevance of adequate data curation and processing for designing trustworthy AI systems, followed by a legal analysis and conceptualization of some difficulties data controllers face for lawful processing of personal data. After reflecting on the legal standards for obtaining data subject's valid consent, the paper argues that legitimate interests (if certain criteria are met) may better match the purpose of building AI training datasets. © 2022 Pablo Trigo Kramcsák","2-s2.0-85142770735"

Deep learning, a branch of AI systems, requires enormous labeled image databases to correctly detect Distal Radius Fractures (DRF). High-reliability AI for DRF detection is challenging to achieve in part because it requires training on a large dataset of at least a thousand images. Detection of DRF needs to be considered in the small dataset images to diagnose and classify images by deep learning methods. The Artificial intelligence-assisted convolutional neural network (AI-CNN) model examines the odds of various events using new sets of comparable data by deducing patterns and rules from massive volumes of data. The collection of X-ray images is followed by an adaptable factor diffusion function for reducing distortion in the collected images. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) extracts the necessary variables from a large dataset. The extracted image is segmented by Kernel-based C-means clustering by categorizing related objects that are visually similar into a single segment. CNN with the two separate output layers detects the features in standard X-ray images. Training and diagnostic evaluations are performed using anteroposterior and lateral plain X-ray pictures of DRF. The Classification is based on the presence or absence of DRF. CNN classifies and identifies the DRF from the training set. The connection of Union tests the practicality of the object identification method. The network's diagnostic performance is calculated under receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and accuracy by measuring the values of Area Under Curve (AUC), Structural Similarity Index and sensitivity.  © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85186139419"

The operations of these devices rely on consuming huge amounts of energy. Power limitation is a major issue hindering the operation of IoT applications and services. To improve operational visibility, Low-power devices which constitute IoT networks, drive the need for sustainable sources of energy to carry out their tasks for a prolonged period of time. Moreover, the means to ensure energy sustainability and QoS must consider the stochastic nature of the energy supplies and dynamic IoT environments. Artificial Intelligence (AI) enhanced protocols and algorithms are capable of predicting and forecasting demand as well as providing leverage at different stages of energy use to supply. AI will improve the efficiency of energy infrastructure and decrease waste in distributed energy systems, ensuring their long-term viability. In this paper, we conduct a survey to explore enhanced AI-based solutions to achieve energy sustainability in IoT applications. AI is relevant through the integration of various Machine Learning (ML) and Swarm Intelligence (SI) techniques in the design of existing protocols. ML mechanisms used in the literature include variously supervised and unsupervised learning methods as well as reinforcement learning (RL) solutions.

The promise of the DL approach has spurred further interest in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) development and applications using both “traditional” machine learning methods and newer DL-based methods. We use the term CAD-AI to refer to this expanded clinical decision support environment that uses traditional and DL-based AI methods. Numerous studies have been published to date on the development of machine learning tools for computer-aided, or AI-assisted, clinical tasks. However, most of these machine learning models are not ready for clinical deployment. It is of paramount importance to ensure that a clinical decision support tool undergoes proper training and rigorous validation of its generalizability and robustness before adoption for patient care in the clinic. To address these important issues, the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Computer-Aided Image Analysis Subcommittee (CADSC) is charged, in part, to develop recommendations on practices and standards for the development and performance assessment of computer-aided decision support systems. The committee has previously published two opinion papers on the evaluation of CAD systems and issues associated with user training and quality assurance of these systems in the clinic. With machine learning techniques continuing to evolve and CAD applications expanding to new stages of the patient care process, the current task group report considers the broader issues common to the development of most, if not all, CAD-AI applications and their translation from the bench to the clinic. The goal is to bring attention to the proper training and validation of machine learning algorithms that may improve their generalizability and reliability and accelerate the adoption of CAD-AI systems for clinical decision support. © 2022 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","2-s2.0-85146090183"

Scaffolding learners in their SRL activities in a computer-based learning environment can help to improve learning outcomes, because students do not always regulate their learning spontaneously. Based on theoretical assumptions, scaffolds should be continuously adaptive and personalized to students' ongoing learning progress in order to promote SRL. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of analytics-based personalized scaffolds, facilitated by a rule-based artificial intelligence (AI) system, on students' learning process and outcomes by real-time measurement and support of SRL using trace data. Using a pre-post experimental design, students received personalized scaffolds (n = 36), generalized scaffolds (n = 32), or no scaffolds (n = 30) during learning. Findings indicated that personalized scaffolds induced more SRL activities, but no effects were found on learning outcomes. Process models indicated large similarities in the temporal structure of learning activities between groups which may explain why no group differences in learning performance were observed. In conclusion, analytics-based personalized scaffolds informed by students’ real-time SRL measured and supported with AI are a first step towards adaptive SRL supports incorporating artificial intelligence that has to be further developed in future research. © 2022 The Authors","2-s2.0-85140890206"

In this work, we aim to bridge this gap for an AI system that predicts the remaining useful life of an aircraft's engine using time series data collected from multiple sensors. We propose a novel approach to compute easily understandable explanations by fusing two explainers in sequence wherein explanations of the first explainer are explained by the second. We use this approach to build a global post-hoc model-agnostic explainer for AI models that ingest multivariate time series data. Our approach fuses a local explainer that yields feature importance weights, with a directly interpretable model that outputs global rules. Our experimental results based on the C-MAPSS open-source dataset demonstrate that the proposed two-stage explainer computes global explanations that are amenable to business users and sheds light on how the behavior of an individual and a group of sensors impacts the remaining useful life of an aircraft's engine.  © 2023 ACM.","2-s2.0-85146146741"

Alongside its many potential advantages, such as easing clinicians’ workload and improving diagnostic accuracy, the use of AI raises ethical and legal concerns, to which there is still no unanimous response. A systematic literature review on medical professional liability related to the use of AI-based diagnostic algorithms was conducted using the public electronic database PubMed selecting studies published from 2020 to 2023. The systematic review was performed according to 2020 PRISMA guidelines. The literature review highlights how the issue of liability in case of AI-related error and patient’s damage has received growing attention in recent years. The application of AI and diagnostic algorithm moreover raises questions about the risks of using unrepresentative populations during the development and about the completeness of information given to the patient. Concerns about the impact on the fiduciary relationship between physician and patient and on the subject of empathy have also been raised. The use of AI in medical field and the application of diagnostic algorithms introduced a revolution in the doctor–patient relationship resulting in multiple possible medico-legal consequences. The regulatory framework on medical liability when AI is applied is therefore inadequate and requires urgent intervention, as there is no single and specific regulation governing the liability of various parties involved in the AI supply chain, nor on end-users. Greater attention should be paid to inherent risk in AI and the consequent need for regulations regarding product safety as well as the maintenance of minimum safety standards through appropriate updates.

Much of the discussion revolves around autonomous weapons systems (AWS) and the 'responsibility gap' they would ostensibly produce. This contribution argues that while some military AI technologies may indeed cause a range of conceptual hurdles in the realm of individual responsibility, they do not raise any unique issues under the law of state responsibility. The following analysis considers the latter regime and maps out crucial junctions in applying it to potential violations of the cornerstone of international humanitarian law (IHL) - the principle of distinction - resulting from the use of AI-enabled military technologies. It reveals that any challenges in ascribing responsibility in cases involving AWS would not be caused by the incorporation of AI, but stem from pre-existing systemic shortcomings of IHL and the unclear reverberations of mistakes thereunder. The article reiterates that state responsibility for the effects of AWS deployment is always retained through the commander's ultimate responsibility to authorise weapon deployment in accordance with IHL. It is proposed, however, that should the so-called fully autonomous weapon systems - that is, machine learning-based lethal systems that are capable of changing their own rules of operation beyond a predetermined framework - ever be fielded, it might be fairer to attribute their conduct to the fielding state, by conceptualising them as state agents, and treat them akin to state organs.

In fact, although AI and chatbots have become increasingly sophisticated, they may not always be able to handle complex or nuanced customer issues. Human agents can better understand and respond to these situations, providing tailored solutions. At the same time, solving non-trivial customer problems often requires access to knowledge bases and contextual customer information, for which AI is particularly well suited. Hence the idea of integrating human and artificial intelligence in a hybrid solution. We developed an AI system to help human assistants in the process of handling conversations. This system can be viewed as a collaborative bot (cobot). The cobot captures the audio stream of the conversation, converts it to text and analyzes it in real time. The extracted tokens are classified and sent to a reasoning system based on a knowledge graph, that provides information and action suggestions to the human assistant. Assistants are also capable of providing information to the reasoning system, utilizing their human understanding of the client's circumstances as they unfold. While designing a prototypical solution for utility services, we have faced the problem of real-time use of computationally complex procedures, including spontaneous speech understanding and knowledge-based heuristic rules. Moreover, we adopted a standards-based approach and experimented with open source reasoners and publicly available language models.

In recent years, various initiatives and works have been undertaken on the European scene to define the directions in which the development and use of artificial intelligence should go. According to the human-centric approach, artificial intelligence should be developed, used and monitored with people in mind, their needs and rights. It is artificial intelligence that should adapt to the rules set by people, not the other way around. The source of all human rights and freedoms is respect for human dignity. This is evidenced by numerous European, international, national regulations and documents. Respecting this value is also one of the works on the AI development. One of the areas of our life into which AI enters more and more boldly and which in the near future, due to demographic reasons and aging population, may be almost dominated by modern technologies, is the medical and care system. The usefulness of industrial co-robots made us think about the possibility of using similar devices in the non-industrial sphere, including in the sphere of care, nursing and therapy. Actually, despite the impressive development of technology and AI, intelligent robots/devices used for care, nursing or therapy (so-called care/nursing or therapy robots) perform rather simple activities. They provide information, navigate, bring something and give it (e.g. medicines, food), help to get up. They are an important support for medical staff in this respect. Performing tasks that are more complex in terms of technology and movement, such as feeding, washing, intimate hygiene, dressing or undressing, is still beyond the reach of the currently used robots. The question we must ask ourselves is whether, in the future, care robots will be able to perform such tasks, and should they do so? Will this lead to the replacement of human medical personnel in the performance of the above-mentioned activities with such robots. Would anyone want to be ""looked after"" by a soulless machine? Should potential wards/patients, in other words all of us in fact, have the right to object to being taken into the care of an intelligent robot? There is no doubt that intelligent robots have great potential, especially when it comes to ensuring or maintaining the independence or mobility of people with various health limitations. However, we must not forget about the risks and dangers they may generate. Even a simple robot generates serious legal and ethical problems. Who should be liable for damage caused in connection with improper care performed with the participation of a robot? Robots based on AI systems are able to collect a significant amount of sensitive data, for example through the face and speech recognition function. There is considerable scope for abuse in this area, not only in terms of personal data protection but also in terms of informational self-determination, privacy and dignity. Bearing in mind the above risks, the creation of a new right to object to being looked after by a robot should be considered. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85130190875"

Based on this discussion, various principles summarizing and categorizing ethical issues have been proposed. To bring these principles into practice, it has been common to repackage them into guidelines for AI ethics. The impact of these guidelines seems to remain small, however, and is considered to be a result of a lack of interest in them. To remedy this issue, other ways of implementing these principles have also been proposed. In this paper, we wish to motivate more discussion on the role of the product in AI ethics. While the lack of adoption of these guidelines and their principles is an issue, we argue that there are also issues with the principles themselves. The principles overlap and conflict and commonly include discussion on issues that seem distant from practice.

This would inhibit software developers from using STPA to analyze their software as part of a bigger system, resulting in a lack of traceability. This can be seen as a maintainability challenge in continuous development and deployment (DevOps). In this paper, STPA's different guidelines for the automotive industry, e.g. J31887/ISO21448/STPA handbook, are firstly compared to assess their applicability to the distributed development of complex AI-enabled systems like AD. Further, an approach to overcome the challenges of using STPA in a multilevel design context is proposed. By conducting an interview study with automotive industry experts for the development of AD, the challenges are validated and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated.  © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85183325020"

Since technical drawings vary a lot depending on the application, it is difficult to gather a large amount of high quality data for AI-based image classification. To overcome this problem, firstly, engineering standard design proceedings and rules including calculations are collected, and the important objects to classify are defined. This information is then implemented into an algorithm that generates the training data. Finally, a parameter analysis is performed evaluating both the influences of the input into the program to generate training data, and the input of the training data on the object detection quality. The approach will be standardized so that it is scalable for other applications. In addition, an outlook on how this methodology could be integrated into teaching practice is given for a particular example. The easy and fast production of large training data sets for object detection puts forward the use of AI especially in engineering education. This concept is an ex-ample for teachers and researchers to reproduce for their own purpose. In this manner, they are capable of using AI for new challenges. Moreover, the paper investigates the impact of the parameters of the training data program and the significance on the object detection of YOLOv4. The influence of the resizing of the image resolution on the object detection quality is analyzed.

The development and application of artificial intelligence in various branches of human activity carry the potential for global changes in society, which, in methodological terms, increases the relevance of considering these problems. The study of ethical problems of artificial intelligence in the concept of sustainable development of society is connected with the dynamic development of innovative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, which are considered a process of becoming a new technosubject in the context of neuroscience development. The article emphasizes that the development of artificial intelligence acts as an innovative form of technology development when a new kind of human-machine technosubject is formed. The authors identify social problems of artificial intelligence application as the digitalization of life becomes a global anthropological challenge. Innovations of artificial intelligence are directly related to a number of ethical problems, as they contribute not only to the sustainable development of society but also cause dehumanization of relations between people and society.

The proposed framework uses agile software life cycle methodology to implement guidelines towards the ethical upgrade of any existing AI system or the development of any new ethically aligned AI system. The guidelines enforce, among others, the minimisation of intentional harm and bias, diversity in data collection, design compliance, auditing of all activities in the framework and ease of code inspection.

While these systems can provide impressive results, they can also be difficult to understand, even for experts in the field. Explainable AI (XAI) is an emerging field of research focused on making AI systems more transparent and interpretable. In this article, we will explore what XAI is, why it matters, and how it works. XAI is an emerging field of research that aims to make AI systems more transparent, interpretable, and accountable. In recent years, AI has made significant advances in fields such as natural language processing, image recognition, and game playing. However, as AI systems become more complex and ubiquitous, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that they are used ethically and responsibly. One of the main challenges with AI is that it can be difficult for humans to understand how the system arrived at a particular decision. For example, a deep learning algorithm might be able to identify objects in an image with incredible accuracy, but it may not be clear how the system arrived at its conclusion. This can lead to a lack of trust in the system, particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. Technically, XAI refers to a set of methods and techniques that enable AI systems to provide human-understandable explanations of their decisions, predictions, and actions. XAI utilizes various approaches such as rule-based systems, decision trees, and model-based techniques to produce explanations that can be interpreted and verified by humans. XAI aims to address the lack of transparency and accountability in traditional black-box AI systems referred in Figure 4.1, which can make it difficult for developers and users to understand and trust these systems. By providing interpretable explanations, XAI can increase the effectiveness, reliability, and trustworthiness of AI systems in a variety of applications. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2023.","2-s2.0-85181628434"

We consider the pattern recognition and forecasting for demand timeseries in a business-to-business supply chain where demand exhibits high volatilities, non-stationarities, and skewness. We develop a pattern forecasting system by developing a data driven, feature dependent Markov chain-based framework. This may include any arbitrary user defined pattern qualitative in nature, such as plummet or recovery from plummet. To increase adoption of AI based techniques among the various stakeholders (e.g., sales, marketing, procurement, production planning) the inherent modeling and forecasting of different patterns needs to be explained in terms of domain knowledge the user is more familiar with. We therefore define two metrices to evaluate explainability to enable cross scenario comparison as the notion of explainability lacks mathematical precision. These are, namely, relevance and informativeness. Relevance is measured by direct scoring from the user whereas informativeness is inspired by the fundamental concept of measuring differences or discrepancies between distributions and for the sake of simplicity in our case measured by the variance in the main attribute of explainability. Moreover, our dataset is high dimensional where number of columns are much higher than number of rows and therefore the method for selecting features for fitting the Markov chain is extremely critical. To provide guidelines on selecting different attributes of our pipeline, we compare between feature selection methods from two families, one advanced and one traditional. We perform extensive evaluation with real dataset obtained from a business division belonging to the Panasonic Industry Co.

The quality of the output depends on crafting a suitable prompt. This has given rise to prompt engineering, the process of designing natural language prompts to best take advantage of the capabilities of generative AI systems.Through experimentation, the creative and research communities have created guidelines and strategies for creating good prompts. However, even for the same task, these best practices vary depending on the particular system receiving the prompt. Moreover, some systems offer additional features using a custom platform-specific syntax, e.g., assigning a degree of relevance to specific concepts within the prompt.In this paper, we propose applying model-driven engineering to support the prompt engineering process. Using a domain-specific language (DSL), we define platform-independent prompts that can later be adapted to provide good quality outputs in a target AI system.

The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care offers solutions to these challenges. AI, a multidisciplinary field, enhances clinical decision-making. However, imbalanced AI models may enhance health disparities. Objective: This systematic review aims to investigate the economic performance and equity impact of AI in diagnostic imaging for skin, neurological, and pulmonary diseases. The research question is “To what extent does the use of AI in imaging exams for diagnosing skin, neurological, and pulmonary diseases result in improved economic outcomes, and does it promote equity in health care systems?” Methods: The study is a systematic review of economic and equity evaluations following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and CHEERS (Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards) guidelines. Eligibility criteria include articles reporting on economic evaluations or equity considerations related to AI-based diagnostic imaging for specified diseases. Data will be collected from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and reference lists. Data quality and transferability will be assessed according to CHEC (Consensus on Health Economic Criteria), EPHPP (Effective Public Health Practice Project), and Welte checklists. Results: This systematic review began in March 2023. The literature search identified 9,526 publications and, after full-text screening, 9 publications were included in the study. We plan to submit a manuscript to a peer-reviewed journal once it is finalized, with an expected completion date in January 2024. Conclusions: AI in diagnostic imaging offers potential benefits but also raises concerns about equity and economic impact. Bias in algorithms and disparities in access may hinder equitable outcomes. Evaluating the economic viability of AI applications is essential for resource allocation and affordability. Policy makers and health care stakeholders can benefit from this review’s insights to make informed decisions. Limitations, including study variability and publication bias, will be considered in the analysis. This systematic review will provide valuable insights into the economic and equity implications of AI in diagnostic imaging. It aims to inform evidence-based decision-making and contribute to more efficient and equitable health care systems. © Giulia Osório Santana, Rodrigo de Macedo Couto, Rafael Maffei Loureiro, Brunna Carolinne Rocha Silva Furriel, Edna Terezinha Rother, Joselisa Péres Queiroz de Paiva, Lucas Reis Correia.","2-s2.0-85182585714"

The complexities of patient healthcare experiences, including doctor-patient interactions, understanding levels, treatment procedures, and preventive care, are considered. We illustrate how a diagnostic process typically integrates various strategies depending on various factors. To digitize the greatest portion of the process, we propose and illustrate the use of LLMs for humanizing the communication process and investigating ways to reduce burdens and costs in primary healthcare. We also outline a theoretical decision model for evaluating the use of technological components from external sources versus building them from scratch.

Thus, on the one hand, CAs can present themselves as benevolent teammates, but on the other hand, they can collect user data, reduce worker autonomy, or foster social isolation by their service. In this work, we conducted 15 expert interviews with senior researchers from the fields of ethics, collaboration, and computer science in order to derive ethical guidelines for introducing CAs in virtual team collaboration.

Its FDA approval for several indications has yielded improved prognosis for cases where traditional therapy has shown limited efficiency. However, many patients still fail to benefit from this treatment modality, and the exact mechanisms responsible for tumor response are unknown. Noninvasive treatment monitoring is crucial for longitudinal tumor characterization and the early detection of non-responders. While various medical imaging techniques can provide a morphological picture of the lesion and its surrounding tissue, a molecular-oriented imaging approach holds the key to unraveling biological effects that occur much earlier in the immunotherapy timeline. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly versatile imaging modality, where the image contrast can be tailored to emphasize a particular biophysical property of interest using advanced engineering of the imaging pipeline. In this review, recent advances in molecular-MRI based cancer immunotherapy monitoring are described. Next, the presentation of the underlying physics, computational, and biological features are complemented by a critical analysis of the results obtained in preclinical and clinical studies.

Most current AI solutions use this modality to analyze the EEG signals in an automated manner to identify the epileptic seizure focus. To develop AI system for identifying the epileptic focus, there are many recently-published AI solutions based on biomarkers or statistic features that utilize interictal EEGs. In this review, we survey these solutions and find that they can be divided into three main categories: (i) those that use of biomarkers in EEG signals, including high-frequency oscillation, phase-amplitude coupling, and interictal epileptiform discharges, (ii) others that utilize feature-extraction methods, and (iii) solutions based upon neural networks (an end-to-end approach). We provide a detailed description of seizure focus with clinical diagnosis methods, a summary of the public datasets that seek to reduce the research gap in epilepsy, recent novel performance evaluation criteria used to evaluate the AI systems, and guidelines on when and how to use them.

Nevertheless, industrial applications take advantage of AI-based systems, and the users are more curious about how and why the decisions are being made by these approaches. Explainable AI (XAI), on the other hand, provides a transparent view, aiming at delivering interpretations according to the obtained information. In order to apply these methods in real-world applications, domain experts need to understand the reasoning behind the applications to support their decision-making. A majority of Explainable AI (XAI) models focus on supervised machine learning, yet the need for unsupervised machine learning explainability is still strong. Since the outcome of conventional unsupervised learning methods lacks the details of domain knowledge, it is difficult to be applied by industries. Moreover, the popular and classic explanation techniques, such as LIME and SHAP, cannot be directly utilized for unsupervised learning interpretation due to the absence of explicit labels or guidance in the datasets. In this work, we introduce an innovative clustering method, SATTree (SHAP-Augmented Threshold Tree), which leverages SHAP to gain a comprehensive understanding of global feature contributions, enhancing our knowledge in the clustering process, then builds up a hierarchical decision tree based on the knowledge of contribution ranking. The proposed approach can depict the properties of clusters with certain decision rule sets collected from the threshold tree. The outcomes of this method are anticipated to surpass expectations in facilitating improvements in real-world applications. © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85186142046"

In addition, the importance of cyber security is being highlighted as cyber threats increase accordingly. In general, rule-based detection approaches have been used to detect cyber threats. The detection rules used in these are broadly set up to reliably detect cyber threats, resulting in too many unnecessary events. This leads to unanalyzed events, which can lead to severe security incidents. To solve this problem, recently, researches on AI-based cyber threat detection system that learns network traffic information and automatically generates detection rules are being conducted. Most of them have used complex model with sophisticated structures or feature engineering techniques so that AI models can learn as much information as possible. But, these are difficult to use in real-world security monitoring environment where quick decisions need to be made in real time, and are not suitable for that environments because they have been trained and verified through only open datasets. In this paper, we propose an AI-based cyber threat detection system that efficiently learns security event characteristics without any complicated process using tree-based model which efficient to learning tabular data. The proposed system detects cyber threats by learning security event characteristics using only information provided from security devices without complicated feature extraction process. In addition, rather than using the used information as a simple value, the value is transformed through a simple process so that the model can learn the event characteristics more effectively. Using the simplicity of the proposed method, it is expected that it can be applied to the real-world environments, and the possibility of this is demonstrated through real-world data.  © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85182952657"

With the increasing focus on bias in AI systems, the bias inheriting or even magnification nature of traditional network pruning methods has raised a new perspective towards fairness-aware network pruning. Straightforward pruning plus debias methods and recent designs for monitoring disparities of demographic attributes during pruning have endeavored to enhance fairness in pruning. However, neither simple assembling of two tasks nor specifically designed pruning strategies could achieve the optimal trade-off among pruning ratio, accuracy, and fairness. This paper proposes an end-to-end learnable framework for fairness-aware network pruning, which optimizes both pruning and debias tasks jointly by adversarial training against those final evaluation metrics like accuracy for pruning, and disparate impact (DI) and equalized odds (DEO) for fairness. In other words, our fairness-aware adversarial pruning method would learn to prune without any handcraft rules. Therefore, our approach could flexibly adapt to variate network structures. Exhaustive experimentation demonstrates the generalization capacity of our approach, as well as superior performance on pruning and debias simultaneously. To highlight, the proposed method could preserve the SOTA pruning performance while significantly improving fairness by around 50% as compared to traditional pruning methods. © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85185871893"

However, AI systems can be just as complex and opaque, leading to concerns about their reliability, trustworthiness, and accountability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a validation framework for Explainable AI (XAI) in Industry 4.0 based on Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs). The proposed framework aims to evaluate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) based on a set of AI metrics and XAI metrics. The FCM-based approach enables the representation of causal-effect relationships between the different concepts of the system using expert knowledge. The presented validation framework provides a theoretical background for evaluating and optimizing the business values of AI systems based on multiple criteria in the manufacturing industry, demonstrating its effectiveness. The main contributions of this paper are: i) the development of an FCM-based validation framework for XAI in Industry 4.0; ii) the identification of relevant AI and XAI metrics for the evaluation of the KPIs of the theoretical graph model; and iii) the demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed framework through a case study. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the importance of considering not only accuracy but also efficiency and transparency when developing AI pipelines that generate higher business value. Overall, this paper offers a theoretical foundation and practical insights for organizations seeking to evaluate the business values of their AI systems in Industry 4.0. It emphasizes the importance of explainability and the integration of AI and XAI metrics in achieving transparent and accountable AI solutions that deliver optimal results for the manufacturing industry and beyond.  © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85181130067"

Information and knowledge professionals working in research libraries are in professions that have long existed and have globally applied ethical codes that serve as self-regulatory ethical norms. New AI technologies that penetrate throughout libraries’ operations cause confusion among librarians and challenge the existing ethics. In this paper, we examine these challenges and present a qualitative study that reveals the ethical considerations that research librarians face when they approach new AI technologies. As there are no established AI ethics norms for research librarians, we compared the international code of conduct for libraries against the European AI guidelines to identify relevant themes for our study. We analyzed the data from two Scandinavian workshops for librarians. Our findings highlight the central role of research libraries in making AI-powered research ethical. Our study also indicates a need to update international codes of conduct for libraries for the AI age by including aspects of AI agency and the interests of future generations. This helps librarians better orient themselves and their patrons towards a trustworthy and existentially sustainable future with AI systems. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","2-s2.0-85180006338"

However, congestion control functionalities in CCN present challenges such as detecting congestion, over-reducing windows for non-congested paths, and addressing fairness issues. Most existing studies employed congestion control mechanisms similar to those in TCP. In addition, the existing mechanisms were based on conventional optimization rules to adjust the rate at which Interest packets are sent to request data from downstream nodes. However, such existing mechanisms do not consider the changes in network status and caching strategy due to multi-path and multi-source transmission. Moreover, they are based on assumptions about link bandwidth. In this paper, we study the problem of congestion control in CCN and discuss its challenges. In addition, we review the existing congestion control schemes in CCN based on machine learning.

It currently operates much like an AI system, in the sense that its actions are guided via a dopamine based reward function, however there is one critical difference, the PFC has the ability to rewire itself - plasticity. Here, we look to biological studies to find the governing rules of plasticity - competitiveness, memory, and correlation - to create a biologically plausible implementation of plasticity called Hybrid Plasticity. We implement it in continuous time recurrent neural networks (CTRNNS) completing simple working memory tasks. We show that the implementation of plasticity increases the adaptability of the working memory process within networks, while also resulting in a significant decrease in active neurons within the network indicating higher efficiency. We further demonstrate that plasticity results in an increased small world index, indicating high levels of efficiency, parallel processing, and cognitive integration as proposed by Global Workspace Theory. Plasticity CTRNNs are also shown to self organize into brain-like connectivity patterns including inhibitory clusters, excitatory clusters, and inhibitory autapses during their forward pass. Hence, Hybrid Plasticity represents a proof-of-concept solution for bringing forth biologically realistic phenomena within neural networks resulting in increased efficiency and generalizability.  © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85182947507"

The aim of this paper is to reveal the discrepancies in ADAS functions across automakers and discuss the underlying issues and potential solutions. In this pilot study, user manuals of various brands are reviewed systematically and critical analyses of common ADAS functions are conducted. The result shows that terminologies used to describe ADAS functions vary widely across manufacturers and sometimes do not reflect their fundamental functions intuitively. Operational conditions and control procedures also vary across the selected models under this study. Due to this lack of consensus across the industry, drivers are not aware or well informed about ADAS functions in their vehicles, leading to a very low utilization rate and may lead to misuse of those functions. This paper provides insightful suggestions for the transport industry, Artificial Intelligence (AI) experts, and regulators to design frameworks and guidelines in governing the naming convention, operating conditions, control procedures, and information disclosure of ADAS.

A substantial body of research underscored the advantages of AI technologies for consumers and identified motivational factors for their adoption. Current systematic literature reviews usually examined the traditional Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and AI Device Use Acceptance (AIDUA), focused on a single solution or technology. On the other hand, the importance of perceived switching cost and measurement of switching behavior is an essential part of well-established and widely used theories (Push-Pull-Mooring (PPM) framework, Status Quo Bias theory, Lazy User Theory, etc.). By following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, this literature review highlights studies that observe switching costs and switching behavior towards AI-based solutions. $\mathrm{N} = 2,739$ articles were initially identified in prominent databases (IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCO Host). After screening, $n = 7$ articles were deemed suitable for inclusion, and most of them relied on the Dual-factor framework and PPM framework. In many cases, these frameworks were integrated with theories and models such as the Status Quo Bias theory, UTAUT, TAM, and TAM3 to provide an understanding of underlying factors affecting user behavior and decision-making. Positive factors influencing switching behavior towards AI adoption include recognizing human limitations, while simultaneously perceiving advantages of AI technology, such as ease of use, efficiency, and personalized experiences. Negative factors, which hinder AI acceptance, encompass privacy risks, inertia, uncertainty, regret avoidance, and cognitive biases.  © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85185843099"

Materials and methods: A total of 215 individuals who underwent both CaCT and PET-CT were enrolled in this retrospective study. The Agatston method was used to calculate the coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) from CaCT, PET-CT(reader), and PET-CT(AI) to analyse the effect of using different modalities and AI-based software on CACS measurement. The total CACS and CACS classified according to the CAC-DRS guidelines were compared between the three sets of CACS. The differences, correlation coefficients, intraclass coefficients (ICC), and concordance rates were analysed. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: The correlation coefficient of the total CACS from CaCT and PET-CT(reader) was 0.837, PET-CT(reader) and PET-CT(AI) was 0.894, and CaCT and PET-CT(AI) was 0.768. The ICC of CACS from CaCT and PET-CT(reader) was 0.911, PET-CT(reader) and PET-CT(AI) was 0.958, and CaCT and PET-CT(AI) was 0.842. The concordance rate between CaCT and PET-CT(AI) was 73.8%, with a false-negative rate of 37.3% and a false-positive rate of 4.4%. Age and male sex were associated with an increased misclassification rate. Conclusions: Artificial intelligence–assisted CACS measurements in PET-CT showed comparable results to CACS in coronary calcium CT. However, the relatively high false-negative results and tendency to underestimate should be of concern. Clinical relevance statement: Application of automated calcium scoring to PET-CT studies could potentially select patients at high risk of coronary artery disease from among cancer patients known to be susceptible to coronary artery disease and undergoing routine PET-CT scans. Key Points: • Cancer patients are susceptible to coronary disease, and PET-CT could be potentially used to calculate coronary artery calcium score (CACS). • Calcium scoring using artificial intelligence in PET-CT automatically provides CACS with high ICC to CACS in coronary calcium CT. • However, underestimation and false negatives of CACS calculation in PET-CT should be considered. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Society of Radiology.","2-s2.0-85176569737"

In order to address those concerns, an increasing number of AI ethics frameworks have been suggested recently, which focus on the algorithmic level rather than the systems level. Nonetheless, some system-level approaches mostly cover a single-level governance pattern of the system components in the entire software design life cycle. However, the need to go beyond the single-level system design AI ethics frameworks to allow not only a better responsible-AI-by-design but also a trustworthy process pattern that abstracts and links the underlying layers of responsible AI on every level. This paper illustrates a principal-to-practice guide of the multi-level governance within organizations across the globe for AI ethics frameworks. We outline the main gap areas in organizations for AI ethics frameworks. Consecutively, we propose a multi-level governance pattern for responsible AI systems within organizations which is participatory, iterative, flexible and operable that targets those main gap areas. Finally, to assist practitioners in applying the multi-level governance AI in organizations and its impact on the industry level, we will translate it into effective and responsible AI practices using a case study. © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85168909129"

Responsible AI involves developing a formal ethical framework for AI; however, an exhaustive treatment for all applied AI research, including the earth sciences, has not been developed yet. Nonetheless, some basic best practices and standards are available now, and others are coming out in the short term. This chapter briefly describes the basic standards for AI ethics and best practices that are readily available now.

These systems indeed require considering explainable/interpretable machine learning algorithms that help physicians to analyze and validate extracted clinical information. To achieve interpretability as well as to deal with uncertainty, Fuzzy Decision Trees (FDT) are widely used in the decision-making process. The rules generated from decision trees quite interest the health care physicians to understand why a decision is made. This chapter mainly focuses on using FDT to express the benefits of explainable AI in health care domain. During the generation of FDT, each node is partitioned into specified number of clusters in general. Here, we propose to use cluster validity measure indices to determine the optimal number of partitions for each node of the tree. This alleviates the problem of choosing cluster numbers by a trial-and-error approach. In the experimental case study considered, HCV medical dataset from the UCI repository is used to construct FDT and to derive fuzzy rules. A total of eight FDTs are built with optimal fuzzy partitions for the nodes in the tree. Fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering and cluster validity measurements are employed to select the optimum partitions that capture the intrinsic structure of the attribute values. Experiments on widely known medical data show that the proposed method can train compact and simple fuzzy rule bases and significantly provide good accuracy with an additional advantage of allowing physicians to interpret the decision-making process. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, [Om Prakash Jena, Mrutyunjaya Panda and Utku Kose]; individual chapters, the contributors.","2-s2.0-85174762263"

This article argues that three additional state roles enable and constrain the agency of states to regulate platforms: facilitator, buyer, and producer. Using the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act as a case study, the article asks: How do different state roles in platform governance shape AI’s regulatory geographies? It answers this research question by outlining two policy dilemmas between those four state roles. First, the EU’s ambition to act as a facilitator of digital markets constrains its scope of interventions as a regulator of platforms. Second, the EU’s deficits in acting as a producer of AI infrastructure exacerbate its dependency as a buyer of Big Tech offerings, especially cloud computing services. The article contends that dilemmas between state roles are not anomalies but defining features of state-platform relations. As generative AI systems gain sophistication, an understanding of how state roles relate to each other helps to navigate their complex governance regimes. © The Author(s) 2023.","2-s2.0-85178371317"

Due to die-placement error and shift during molding, die assemblies on FOWLP can have significant die-shift. Design rules must ensure the accommodation of die-shift and as a result fine-pitch patterning is limited. TrueAdapt™ aims to solve that by utilizing in-line characterization of the die shift, generation of a new layout using the measured offsets, and patterning with direct-write lithography for high throughput wafer-level and panel-level fabrication at fine-pitches. In this work we present the fabrication of an assembly of dies interconnected in a daisy chain network with 10 µm pitch wiring on the FlexTrate™, a bio-compatible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based FOWLP architecture. We measure die shift using optical metrology techniques to generate a stitched image of the assembly. The image is then processed using artificial intelligence (AI) computer vision to identify critical features on the dies (which are used to generate die-offsets for each die). Furthermore, we generate a layout based on measured die-shift that adaptively routes the wiring in between dies. Via and metal layers are subsequently patterned using direct-write lithography using a 405 nm lase. Direct-write lithography enables fine-pitch patterning at the wafer/panel level without the need for mask fabrication, promising significant cost savings. We further demonstrate a novel exposure technique based on focal extension that can be utilized to pattern over 100 µm of topography, making this a truly adaptive patterning process.  © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85168310942"

These approaches have encountered both philosophical and computational limitations. They often struggle to accommodate remarkably diverse, unstable, complex contexts of human-AI interactions. Recently there has been an increasing interest among philosophers and computer scientists in building a relational approach to the ethics of AI. This article engages with Daniel A. Bell and Pei Wang’s most recent book Just Hierarchy and explores how their theory of just hierarchy can be employed to develop a more systematic account for relational AI ethics. Bell and Wang’s theory of just hierarchy acknowledges that there are morally justified situations in which social relations are not equal. Just hierarchy can exist both between humans and between humans and machines such as AI systems. Therefore, a relational ethic for AI based on just hierarchy can include two theses: (i) AI systems should be considered merely as tools and their relations with humans are hierarchical (e.g. designing AI systems with lower moral standing than humans); and (ii) the moral assessment of AI systems should focus on whether they help us realize our role-based moral obligations prescribed by our social relations with others (these relations often involve diverse forms of morally justified hierarchies in communities). Finally, this article will discuss the practical implications of such a relational ethic framework for designing socially integrated and ethically responsive AI systems. © 2023 by Centre for Ethics, KU Leuven.

Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into telemedicine has the potential to enhance and expand its capabilities in addressing various healthcare needs, such as patient monitoring, healthcare information technology (IT), intelligent diagnosis, and assistance. Despite the potential benefits, implementing AI in telemedicine presents challenges that can be overcome with physician-guided implementation. AI can assist physicians in decision-making, improve healthcare delivery, and automate administrative tasks. To ensure optimal effectiveness, AI-powered telemedicine should comply with existing clinical practices and adhere to a framework adaptable to various technologies. It should also consider technical and scientific factors, including trustworthiness, reproducibility, usability, availability, and cost. Education and training are crucial for the appropriate use of new healthcare technologies such as AI-enabled telemedicine.

To tap into the dark data, domain experts analyze and extract insights and integrate them into the data repositories. This process can involve out-of-DBMS, ad-hoc analysis, and processing resulting in ETL, engineering effort, and suboptimal performance. While AI systems based on ML models can automate the analysis process, they often further generate context-rich answers. Using multiple sources of truth, for either training the models or in the form of knowledge bases, further exacerbates the problem of consolidating the data of interest.We envision an analytical engine co-optimized with components that enable context-rich analysis. Firstly, as the data from different sources or resulting from model answering cannot be cleaned ahead of time, we propose using online data integration via model-assisted similarity operations. Secondly, we aim for a holistic pipeline cost- and rule-based optimization across relational and model-based operators.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise in medical decision-making, particularly in ophthalmology. Yet, the diagnostic precision and management advice from AI-based uveitis chatbots lack assessment. Methods: We appraised diagnostic accuracy and management suggestions of an AI-based chatbot, ChatGPT, versus five uveitis-trained ophthalmologists, using 25 standard cases aligned with new Uveitis Nomenclature guidelines. Participants predicted likely diagnoses, two differentials, and next management steps. Comparative success rates were computed. Results: Ophthalmologists excelled (60–92%) in likely diagnosis, exceeding AI (60%). Considering fully and partially accurate diagnoses, ophthalmologists achieved 76–100% success; AI attained 72%. Despite an 8% AI improvement, its overall performance lagged. Ophthalmologists and AI agreed on diagnosis in 48% cases, with 91.6% exhibiting concurrence in management plans. Conclusions: The study underscores AI chatbots' potential in uveitis diagnosis and management, indicating their value in reducing diagnostic errors.

The design of Human-Centered AI (HCAI) is one approach to address these challenges. Design guidelines and principles are provided to assist AI developers in the design of HCAI. However, these principles are currently defined for AI in general and not for specific application contexts. The aim of this work is to analyze whether existing design principles for HCAI are transferable to IAI-based services in manufacturing and how they can be integrated into the development process. In an explorative-qualitative research design, the design pattern of the People + AI Guidebook by the PAIR from Google were analyzed regarding their applicability in manufacturing environments. The finding show that a transfer of the design principles is generally possible.

In numerous applications, such as marketing, fraud detection, telecommunication, and manufacturing, it is an unavoidable step. The complexity of the discovery process has risen along with the volume of data during the past few decades. In this situation, artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions have emerged as the most advantageous. However, there is a lack of a rigorous strategy in the knowledge extraction and reuse processes. A qualitative research paradigm known as Design Science Research (DSR), provides systematic recommendations for the generalization and transferability of newly produced knowledge utilizing artifacts. In this research, we present an artifact for the early prediction of impacted micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)-based inertial sensors. MEMS-based inertial sensor manufacturing is complex and time-consuming. Moreover, there is a persistent need for more precise products, streamlined production stages, and quicker solutions. One way of achieving this is through optimized manufacturing processes using AI-based solutions. However, many difficulties are encountered, including problems with data collection, data analysis, computational power availability, platform compatibility, etc. Thorough and systemic guidelines can ensure the avoidance of all these issues. The proposed artifact is created using a DSR approach utilizing various machine learning algorithms for predictive maintenance of MEMS-based inertial sensors along with providing optimal feature selection methods. A thorough demonstration of the artifact designing and evaluation process is provided using a real use case. The manufacturing process has been improved by further investigation of the results to help with knowledge discovery and re-usability. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","2-s2.0-85174718277"

Periodontal disease is one of the most common oral diseases. The early diagnosis of periodontal disease is essential for effective treatment and a favorable prognosis. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of AI in diagnosing periodontal bone loss through radiographic analysis. Materials and Methods: A literature search involving 5 databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Health and Medical Collection, Dentistry and Oral Sciences) was carried out. A specific combination of keywords was used to obtain the articles. The PRISMA guidelines were used to filter eligible articles. The study design, sample size, type of AI software, and the results of each eligible study were analyzed. The CASP diagnostic study checklist was used to evaluate the evidence strength score. Results: Seven articles were eligible for review according to the PRISMA guidelines. Out of the 7 eligible studies, 4 had strong CASP evidence strength scores (7-8/9). The remaining studies had intermediate CASP evidence strength scores (3.5-6.5/9). The highest area under the curve among the reported studies was 94%, the highest F1 score was 91%, and the highest specificity and sensitivity were 98.1% and 94%, respectively. Conclusion: AI-based detection of periodontal bone loss using radiographs is an efficient method. However, more clinical studies need to be conducted before this method is introduced into routine dental practice. © 2023 by Korean Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology","2-s2.0-85173049942"

Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in healthcare interventions. We sought to review the conduct and reporting of published HEEs for AI-based health interventions. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review with a 15-month search window (April 2021 to June 2022) on 17th June 2022 to identify HEEs of AI health interventions and update a previous review. Records were identified from 3 databases (Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central). Two reviewers screened papers against predefined study selection criteria. Data were extracted from included studies using prespecified data extraction tables. Included studies were quality assessed using the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) checklist. Results were synthesized narratively. Results: A total of 21 studies were included. The most common type of AI intervention was automated image analysis (9/21, 43%) mainly used for screening or diagnosis in general medicine and oncology. Nearly all were cost-utility (10/21, 48%) or cost-effectiveness analyses (8/21, 38%) that took a healthcare system or payer perspective. Decision-analytic models were used in 16/21 (76%) studies, mostly Markov models and decision trees. Three (3/16, 19%) used a short-term decision tree followed by a longer-term Markov component. Thirteen studies (13/21, 62%) reported the AI intervention to be cost effective or dominant. Limitations tended to result from the input data, authorship conflicts of interest, and a lack of transparent reporting, especially regarding the AI nature of the intervention. Conclusion: Published HEEs of AI-based health interventions are rapidly increasing in number. Despite the potentially innovative nature of AI, most have used traditional methods like Markov models or decision trees. Most attempted to assess the impact on quality of life to present the cost per QALY gained. However, studies have not been comprehensively reported. Specific reporting standards for the economic evaluation of AI interventions would help improve transparency and promote their usefulness for decision making. This is fundamental for reimbursement decisions, which in turn will generate the necessary data to develop flexible models better suited to capturing the potentially dynamic nature of AI interventions.

In practice, data from several heterogeneous data sources is integrated, but complete, global domain knowledge is often not available. In such heterogeneous scenarios, it is particularly difficult to monitor data quality (e.g., completeness, accuracy, timeliness) over time. In this paper, we formally introduce a new data-centric method for automated data quality monitoring, which is based on reference data profiles. A reference data profile is a set of data profiling statistics that is learned automatically to model the target quality of the data. In contrast to most existing data quality approaches that require domain experts to define rules, our method can be fully automated from initialization to continuous monitoring. This data-centric method has been implemented in our data quality tool DQ-MeeRKat and evaluated with six real-world telematic device data streams. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85172682110"

Traditional intrusion prevention methods often rely on rule-based approaches that can be inflexible and prone to false positives and false negatives. The emergence of explainable artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has the potential to provide more accurate and interpretable solutions for intrusion prevention. This review paper surveys the current state of the art in explainable AI techniques for intrusion prevention, including their strengths and limitations. We begin by providing an overview of intrusion prevention and the challenges faced by traditional methods. We then explore the different types of explainable AI techniques, such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), and Integrated Gradients, and their application to intrusion prevention. We also discuss the different types of datasets and evaluation metrics used in explainable AI-based intrusion prevention, including public datasets such as NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. Finally, we highlight the future research directions in explainable AI-based intrusion prevention, including the need for larger and more diverse datasets, better evaluation metrics, and more comprehensive explainable AI models.

Medical decision support solutions have advanced greatly with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), a rapidly developing sector in the medical industry. Great promise has been shown in its ability to anticipate patients' clinical conditions and aid clinical decision-making. Early prediction, prognosis evaluation, mortality prediction, and optimum treatment are just few of the areas where algorithms developed using artificial intelligence may be put to use.

Initially deployed by Google to predict text input on mobile devices, FL has been deployed in many other industries. Since its introduction, Federated Learning mainly exploited the inner working of neural networks and other gradient descent-based algorithms by either exchanging the weights of the model or the gradients computed during learning. While this approach has been very successful, it rules out applying FL in contexts where other models are preferred, e.g., easier to interpret or known to work better. This paper proposes to leverage distributed versions of the AdaBoost algorithm to acquire strong federated models. In contrast with previous approaches, our proposal does not put any constraint on the client-side learning models and does not rely on inner workings of the learning algorithms used in the clients. We perform a large set of experiments on ten UCI datasets, comparing the algorithms in six non-iidness settings. Results show that the approach is effective, in the case of an IID setting, results are often near to the theoretical optimum (i.e., the performances of AdaBoost on the complete dataset). In case of non-IID settings, results very much depend on the severity of the non-IIDness. © 2023 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-85173481719"

Several popular approaches to explaining black-box AI systems, such as neural networks, focus either on highlighting the features that matter the most in one particular decision as in the SHAP models, or on developing a local to the particular instance data model that is explainable by nature, such as a decision tree. ML systems that are by default explainable and/or interpretable, such as decision trees, or rule-based systems do not require such third-party approaches, as they are themselves explainable. Nevertheless, presenting a consistent (small) set of features to the users as explanations for any given proposed decision can increase the confidence of the users towards the reliability of the system. For this reason, we have developed a system that given a set of rules that hold on a training dataset, finds a minimal cardinality set of features that are used in a set of rules that together cover the entire training dataset. We develop a parallel heuristic algorithm for finding such a minimal variables set, and we show it outperforms all state-of-the-art optimization solvers for finding the solution to a MIP formulation of the problem. Experiments with data from use cases applying AI in public policy decision making as well as in medical use cases show that the proposed small set of features is sufficient to explain all the cases in the test dataset via rules containing only variables from the proposed set of features.  © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85174403487"

The paper studies the impact of cognitive computing on audit risk. AI-powered software is capable of self-learn so that it can identify patterns in data and codify them in predictions, rules and decisions. This self-learning ability can become both a benefit and, at the same time, insecurity. Although AI-self-learning helps make the process more efficient and calculations more accurate by improving the algorithm, eliminating errors and reducing risks, it creates new previously unknown threats. We discovered inherent limitations of cognitive-based technologies and risks for the audit process associated with using AI systems. We also proposed a complex security model that can reduce the uncertainty of AI-enabled audit and provides insight into future research opportunities. © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85175575982"

Conventional methods for incorporating such knowledge into guideline development often involve a limited number of representatives and are considered to be time-consuming. Including experiential knowledge can be crucial during rapid guidance production in response to a pandemic but it is difficult to accomplish. Objective: This proof-of-concept study explored the potential of artificial intelligence (AI)–based methods to capture experiential knowledge and value considerations from existing data channels to make these insights available for public health guideline development. Methods: We developed and examined AI-based methods in relation to the COVID-19 vaccination guideline development in the Netherlands. We analyzed Dutch messages shared between December 2020 and June 2021 on social media and on 2 databases from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), where experiences and questions regarding COVID-19 vaccination are reported. First, natural language processing (NLP) filtering techniques and an initial supervised machine learning model were developed to identify this type of knowledge in a large data set. Subsequently, structural topic modeling was performed to discern thematic patterns related to experiences with COVID-19 vaccination. Results: NLP methods proved to be able to identify and analyze experience-based knowledge and value considerations in large data sets. They provide insights into a variety of experiential knowledge that is difficult to obtain otherwise for rapid guideline development. Some topics addressed by citizens, patients, and professionals can serve as direct feedback to recommendations in the guideline. For example, a topic pointed out that although travel was not considered as a reason warranting prioritization for vaccination in the national vaccination campaign, there was a considerable need for vaccines for indispensable travel, such as cross-border informal caregiving, work or study, or accessing specialized care abroad. Another example is the ambiguity regarding the definition of medical risk groups prioritized for vaccination, with many citizens not meeting the formal priority criteria while being equally at risk. Such experiential knowledge may help the early identification of problems with the guideline’s application and point to frequently occurring exceptions that might initiate a revision of the guideline text. Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study presents NLP methods as viable tools to access and use experience-based knowledge and value considerations, possibly contributing to robust, equitable, and applicable guidelines. They offer a way for guideline developers to gain insights into health professionals, citizens, and patients’ experience-based knowledge, especially when conventional methods are difficult to implement. AI-based methods can thus broaden the evidence and knowledge base available for rapid guideline development and may therefore be considered as an important addition to the toolbox of pandemic preparedness. ©Lea Lösch, Teun Zuiderent-Jerak, Florian Kunneman, Elena Syurina, Marloes Bongers, Mart L Stein, Michelle Chan, Willemine Willems, Aura Timen.","2-s2.0-85171309508"

A biased data set is not representative of reality and might contribute to perpetuate societal biases within the model. To tackle this problem, it is important to understand how to avoid biases, errors, and unethical practices while creating the data sets. In this work we offer a preliminary framework for the semi-Automated evaluation of fairness in data sets, by combining statistical information about data with qualitative consideration. We address the issue of how much (un)fairness can be included in a data set used for machine learning research, focusing on classification issues. In order to provide guidance for the use of data sets in contexts of critical decision-making, such as health decisions, we identify six fundamental features (balance, numerosity, unevenness, compliance, quality, incompleteness) that could affect model fairness. We developed a rule-based approach based on fuzzy logic that combines these characteristics into a single score and enables a semi-Automatic evaluation of a data set in algorithmic fairness research.  © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85174930182"

However, there currently is a lack of knowledge, especially systematically derived design knowledge, regarding customer trust in interacting with AI-based chatbots. In this context, a lack of security and transparency, limited social features, and the communication style and quality-related issues of AI-based chatbots are just a few aspects that inhibit customer trust in interacting with this innovative technology, thereby hindering the adoption of chatbots. To address this knowledge gap, we adopted a design theory-based approach and developed a design concept for trust-supporting design knowledge regarding customer interaction with an AI-based chatbot. Design science provides a structured development and evaluation process to support, for example, the adoption of AI-based chatbots. Drawing on trust-based literature, a use case in customer service in the automotive industry, and seven semi-structured expert interviews, we propose 10 meta/user requirements and four design principles for trust-supporting design elements as (e.g. social) signals (stimuli) regarding the interaction with AI-based chatbots. We developed two click prototypes over two evaluation cycles. Each evaluation included an online survey with 180 participants. The findings that were obtained make a valuable contribution to solving the described lack of design knowledge by developing and evaluating different design approaches in the form of prototypical user interfaces. Moreover, the results show that visible design elements such as transparent and factual security signals (stimuli) and trust seals have a significant impact on customer trust. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-85176389429"

Artificial intelligence (AI) can learn, reason, and understand the enormous corpus of literature available to the scientific community. However, large-scale studies comparing the recommendations of AI and a multidisciplinary team board (MTB) in gastric cancer treatment have rarely been performed. Therefore, a retrospective real-world study was conducted to assess the level of concordance between AI and MTB treatment recommendations. Methods: Treatment recommendations of Watson for Oncology (WFO) and an MTB were retrospectively analyzed 322 patients with gastric cancer from January 2015 to December 2018 and the degree of agreement between them was compared. The patients were divided into concordance and non-concordance groups and factors affecting the concordance rate were analyzed. Results: The concordance rate between the AI and MTB was 86.96%. The concordance rates for each stage were 96.93% for stage I, 88.89% for stages II, 90.91% for stage III, and 45.83% for stage IV, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, age (p-value = 0.000), performance status (p-value = 0.003 for performance score 1; p-value = 0.007 for performance score 2; p-value = 0.000 for performance score 3), and stage IV (p-value = 0.017) had a significant effect on concordance between the MTB and WFO. Conclusion: Factors affecting the concordance rate were age, performance status, and stage IV gastric cancer. To increase the validity of future medical AI systems for gastric cancer treatment, their supplementation with local guidelines and the ability to comprehensively understand individual patients is essential. © 2023, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85171160496"

In addition, this study examines whether the identified configurations could further enhance applicants' organisational commitment (OC). Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the justice model of applicants' reactions, the authors conducted a longitudinal survey of 254 newly recruited employees from 36 Chinese companies that utilise AI in their hiring. The authors employed fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to determine which configurations could improve APJP and AIJP, and the authors used propensity score matching (PSM) to analyse the effects of these configurations on OC. Findings: The fsQCA generates three patterns involving five configurations that could improve APJP and AIJP. For pattern 1, when AI-based recruitment with high interpersonal rule (AI human involvement) aims for applicants' justice perception (AJP) through the combination of high informational rule (AI explainability) and high procedural rule (AI voice), there must be high levels of AI consistency and AI voice to complement AI explainability, and only this pattern of configurations can further enhance OC. In pattern 2, for the combination of high informational rule (AI explainability) and low procedural rule (absent AI voice), AI recruitment with high interpersonal rule (AI human involvement) should focus on AI transparency and AI explainability rather than the implementation of AI voice. In pattern 3, a mere combination of procedural rules could sufficiently improve AIJP. Originality/value: This study, which involved real applicants, is one of the few empirical studies to explore the mechanisms behind the impact of AI hiring decisions on AJP and OC, and the findings may inform researchers and managers on how to best utilise AI to make hiring decisions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2-s2.0-85175612938"

It also aids in holding violators accountable and supports data-driven decision-making for infrastructure enhancements. To address these challenges, the integration of AI-based methods for automated violation detection is increasingly vital, reducing the need for manual oversight. Low-light conditions pose additional difficulties, as violations become harder to detect. In this study, we created a novel dataset containing 1032 images with 1475 two-wheeler violations under low-light conditions. We propose a real-time deep learning system using YOLO-v8 for two-wheeler violation detection. Our system addresses the challenge of low-light conditions by incorporating a real-time low-light video enhancement module. Through comprehensive evaluations, our system has achieved an average precision of 98.2%, recall of 97.5%, and an accuracy of 97.05% when tested on our custom dataset. Notably, it successfully detected 172 out of 188 violations in the test dataset and exhibited 60% faster processing compared to other state-of-the-art methods. This suggests that our system not only outperforms existing methods on public datasets but also excels in terms of performance and accuracy when applied to the specifically constructed low-light traffic dataset.

To address this gap, we propose a neural-symbolic architecture that augments symbolic approaches with sub-symbolic components, in order to broaden the scope of the identified causalities. Concretely, we use Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) to solve causality knowledge derivation as a link prediction problem. Experimental results show that the neural-symbolic approach can predict causality knowledge with a good performance and has the potential to predict causalities that were not present in the symbolic system, thus broadening the causality knowledge scope of symbolic approaches. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","2-s2.0-85167395516"

We draw on the literatures on machine learning-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) as well as on human decision-making to propose conditions under which human-AI ensembles can be useful. We argue that human and AI-based algorithmic decision-making can be usefully ensembled even when neither has a clear advantage over the other in terms of predictive accuracy, and even if neither alone can attain satisfactory accuracy in absolute terms. Many managerial decisions have these attributes, and collaboration between humans and AI is usually ruled out in such contexts because the conditions for specialization are not met.

The COVID-19 crisis compelled the employees to work virtually. To mitigate the effects of COVID-19, several organisations heavily invested in artificial intelligence (AI) in the realm of HRM. Purpose: With limited studies on the paradigm shift in HRM postpandemic and the role of AI, the study investigates and proposes a conceptual framework for the paradigm shift in HRM practices post-COVID-19 pandemic and the significance of AI. Furthermore, the study investigates the outcomes of the use of AI in HRM for organisations and employees. Methodology: A comprehensive review of the literature based on the guidelines of Tranfield, Denyer, and Smart (2003) and Crossan and Apaydin (2010) has been followed. A systematic literature review assisted in critically analysing, synthesising, and mapping the extant literature by identifying the broad themes involved. Findings: COVID-19-related economic disruption has led to a paradigm shift in HRM practices. AI-enabled HRM practices are now centred around remote and contingent workforce management, mindfulness, social capital, increasing employee engagement, reskilling and upskilling towards new competencies, etc. AI is making remote work seamless through smooth recruitment and selection process, onboarding, career and development, tracking and managing the performance, facilitating learning, and talent management. Post-pandemic, AI-powered tools based on data mining (DM), predictive analytics, big data analytics, natural language processing (NLP), intelligent robots, machine learning (ML), virtual (VR)/augmented reality (AR), etc., have paved the way for managing the HRM practices effectively, thereby leading to enhanced organisational performance, employee well-being, automation, and reduced cost. © 2023 by Akansha Mer and Amarpreet Singh Virdi.","2-s2.0-85169072758"

Aims: To describe the design, rationale and methods of a cluster-randomised multifaceted intervention trial aimed at investigating the effect of cerebrovascular disease AI-CDSS on the clinical outcomes of patients who had a stroke and on stroke care quality. Design: The GOLDEN BRIDGE II trial is a multicentre, open-label, cluster-randomised multifaceted intervention study. A total of 80 hospitals in China were randomly assigned to the AI-CDSS intervention group or the control group. For eligible participants with acute ischaemic stroke in the AI-CDSS intervention group, cerebrovascular disease AI-CDSS will provide AI-assisted imaging analysis, auxiliary stroke aetiology and pathogenesis analysis, and guideline-based treatment recommendations. In the control group, patients will receive the usual care. The primary outcome is the occurrence of new vascular events (composite of ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death) at 3 months after stroke onset. The sample size was estimated to be 21 689 with a 26% relative reduction in the incidence of new composite vascular events at 3 months by using multiple quality-improving interventions provided by AI-CDSS. All analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle and accounted for clustering using generalised estimating equations. Conclusions: Once the effectiveness is verified, the cerebrovascular disease AI-CDSS could improve stroke care and outcomes in China.

The proposal is designed to regulate AI systems in different European economic sectors, including Medical Devices (MD).

The analysis focuses on Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) and Software in a Medical Device (SiMD), excluding general-purpose AI systems and machinery products (i.e., driven systems and safety components), as investigation in the Machinery Directive legislation is required. The strategy is to identify the classification conditions for AI systems by mapping key terms and definitions related to Article 6 in the AIA. Then, these conditions are translated into propositions suitable for the MD domain and presented in a flow chart for discussion. The primary source of information for the analysis is the MDR and the AIA, considering the latest revisited version of the proposal (Presidency compromise text, document 11124/22).

The objectives of these systems can however be contradictory, for instance optimal climate may require high energy use. Thus, an intermediate solution needs to be found between these objectives. As the number of control systems being used in the greenhouse increases, this becomes more complex for the human grower. Therefore, we have developed the GAIA system that supports the grower in finding this intermediate solution. GAIA takes as input a weighted performance function of the individual control system objectives. As output, GAIA presents a prediction of the best setpoints for each system that together maximize the performance function value. To achieve this, GAIA uses a combination of data-driven AI techniques, a model-based prediction algorithm and a knowledge base with expert control rules. The system supports explainability of its results and active feedback loops with the grower. Preliminary simulation results with a tomato plant model show that the GAIA predictions are very close to the targeted optimal values.

In this chapter, we will endeavor on a journey to explore how Foucault’s conception of “madness” along with Canguilhem’s distinction between the “normal and the pathological” can be utilized in an analysis of AI systems. Approaching AI from a philosophical, or even a psychoanalytic perspective, may seem prima facie bizarre or out of place. However, as we shall see AI applications may be considered as peculiar types of machines. Due to their proximity to the human, or shall we say the “man behind the machine,” we believe that some categories of thought which were reserved for organic life are quite relevant here. Canguilhem believed that there is no pathological machine. A machine can only malfunction. However, an organism at the pathological state is not an organism in a chaotic state, but in one with its own set of rules. What if such a set of rules emerges from a deep learning “machine”? Foucault was well aware of how normality is enforced and how madness is institutionalized. Using this as a metaphor, one could expand on how this institutionalization affects the opacity of AI, creating an obscure mechanical “madness.”. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, David M.

Typically, deep neural networks (DNNs) are used as these provide the best performance on the challenging perception, prediction or planning tasks that occur in real driving environments. However, current regulations like UNECE R 155 or ISO 26262 do not consider AI-related aspects and are only applied to traditional algorithm-based systems. The non-existence of AI-specific standards or norms prevents the practical application and can harm the trust level of users. Hence, it is important to extend existing standardization for security and safety to consider AI-specific challenges and requirements. To take a step towards a suitable regulation we propose 50 technical requirements or best practices that extend existing regulations and address the concrete needs for DNN-based systems. We show the applicability, usefulness and meaningfulness of the p roposed requirements by performing an exemplary audit of a DNN-based traffic sign recognition system using three of the proposed requirements. © 2023 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","2-s2.0-85176347974"

In response to maintaining cleanliness in business-to-business (B2B) settings, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled robots have been adopted as substitutes for cleaning personnel, yet their implications remain largely underexamined. This study aims to examine B2B buyer responses to cleaning information notices (human vs AI-enabled agent) placed at either the entry to the premises or the sales counter, thereby adding to the nascent literature in this line of inquiry. Design/methodology/approach: Three field experiments were conducted across diverse B2B businesses (wholesalers in Studies 1–2 and a commercial business in Study 3). To achieve greater empirical rigor and generalizability, this research used diverse stimuli across different B2B settings. In addition, the results ruled out alternate explanations and shed light upon political ideology as a boundary condition. Finally, a single-paper meta-analysis confirmed H1, consolidating the established effect. Findings: Featuring over 1,000 B2B buyers, the results show that politically liberal B2B buyers express greater preference for human over AI-performed cleaning while labor-orientated buyers are indifferent. Importantly, this effect is driven by greater relaxation associated with humans, which in turn, increases their future patronage and referral intent. Originality/value: The results enrich the collective knowledge of the adoption of AI-enabled robots, reinforcing for marketing practitioners and businesses that the reliance on human-based outcomes remains a preferred touchpoint in B2B settings, particularly for liberals. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2-s2.0-85168882036"

Various factors can cause olfactory dysfunction, including COVID-19 infection, which has increased anosmia cases. No medications are approved; however, recent studies have suggested that intranasal insulin could effectively treat olfactory dysfunction. Aim: To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intranasal insulin in treating olfactory dysfunction. Materials and Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, and CENTRAL databases were searched using specific keywords, and the outputs were screened using the Rayyan AI system. Original research articles published without time frame limitations that reported the relevant outcomes were included. The reviewers performed the screening and data extraction, and any disagreements were resolved by a third senior author. Results: This systematic review identified 66 references from 3 databases, with 45 articles meeting the criteria for review after duplicates were removed. Six articles met the inclusion criteria and were selected, including 177 subjects. The selected studies consisted of various study designs, including pilot studies, placebo-controlled trials, crossover studies, and randomized clinical trials. The findings showed that intranasal insulin therapy had beneficial effects on olfactory function. Specifically, improvements were observed in olfactory detection and discrimination in patients with post-COVID-19 anosmia, olfactory threshold performance in healthy participants, and odor identification in hyposmic patients. However, there were variations in the observed effects based on different doses of insulin administered and gender differences. It also shows that using insulin provides good outcomes. Using it intranasally was safe and did not cause any complications. Conclusion: Intranasal insulin has shown promising results as a potentially safe treatment for olfactory dysfunction. Studies suggest that it can improve olfactory thresholds. Further studies are needed to investigate optimal doses and potential gender differences in response. © The Author(s) 2023.","2-s2.0-85173479187"

The study surveyed 220 people via online questionnaire to learn more about their experiences with and motivations for using AI-powered conversational agents. An overview of the demographics of the participants was provided through descriptive statistics. This investigation of the subject at hand lays the groundwork for further research. It also reveals the hidden meanings of the observed phenomena, and it suggests possible solutions to the problems that have been uncovered. This research looks at how AI systems and chatbots can supplement human knowledge and judgment, as well as their potential drawbacks. The results showed that participants thought Chat GPT integration was moderately accessible and had moderately positive social attitudes. They understood the value and responsibility of Chat GPT in creating individualized educational opportunities. Participants stressed the necessity for explicit institutional standards regarding privacy and data security. Gender, age, sense of accessibility, social attitude, opinions, and personal experience, privacy and data security, institutional guidelines, and individualized learning were also found to affect participants' reliance on AI through regression analysis. The findings shed light on how the integration of Chat GPT into Latinoamerican higher education is complicated by factors such as individual beliefs, cultural norms, and ethical problems. The busy schedules of students may be accommodated and the resources they need to succeed can be made available thanks to this adaptability. In addition, natural language processing models can offer students instantaneous help via text chat, voice, or video. To fully grasp the ethical consequences and lead the creation of responsible implementation techniques, the research proposes that additional qualitative investigations, longitudinal studies, and comparative research across diverse contexts is required. Closing these knowledge gaps will help move the conversational AI field forward in ways that are ethical and beneficial to the classroom. © The Author 2023.

So, in order to avoid making wrong decisions, we develop an automated AI-based solution. This project focus on a technology that helps both the main umpire and third umpire to makes critical determination for Leg Before the Wicket (LBW) regarding whether the batsman is out or not-out and also minimizes the waiting time for players until the third umpire go through the trajectory of the ball to make a correct decision. The main purpose of our AI-DRS is to remove the umpires call which plays a vital role in giving third umpires decision because whether any one of the cases shows umpires call the decision will be stick with on-field umpires call whether it may be out or not-out. The pitch report and comprehensive cricket laws are also included for the sake of the game. The pitch report will be examined with several key wicket characteristics, such as kind of soil, cracks, amount of grass cover, and wetness, etc. using drone we capture the video of the match day pitch. To determine the field crack, canny edge detection is performed and soil moisture sensor is used to determine the moisture content of the soil. This information help cricket team to make a decision about whether to bat or field after winning the toss and helps to choose the strongest 11 players through which can win the match on that pitch on that day. Utilizing support vector machine (SVM) and histograms of gradients (HOG), objects are classified and recognized. In order to monitor and forecast the velocity of the ball, linear regression and quadratic regression are applied. Finally, Tkinter is used for GUI development, imutils and OpenCV are used as implementation tools. Due to the controversy of rare wicket calls, boundary and penalty runs, we bring a voice recognized AI system which gave fans to easily understand why this decision is made by the umpire and sometime umpires found difficulty to remember some rules which is rarely used in cricket it will also give assist to on-field umpires to give a very clear idea why he made the decision, the on-field umpires can easily access the laws through voice recognition which use Alan-AI.

This paper clarifies the concept of an “explanation”: the main goal of an explanation is to build trust in the recipient of the explanation. This can only be achieved by creating an understanding of the results of the AI systems in terms of the users’ domain knowledge. In contrast to most of the approaches found in the literature, which base the explanation of the AI system’s results on the model provided by the machine learning algorithm, this paper tries to find an explanation in the specific expert knowledge of the system’s users. The domain knowledge is defined as a formal model derived from a set of if-then-rules provided by experts. The result from the AI system is represented as a proposition in a temporal logic. Now we attempt to formally prove this proposition within the domain model. We use model checking algorithms and tools for this purpose. If the proof is successful, the result of the AI system is consistent with the model of the domain knowledge. The model contains the rules it is based on and hence the path representing the proof can be translated back to the rules: this explains, why the proposition is consistent with the domain knowledge. The paper describes the application of this approach to a real world example from meteorology, the short-term forecasting of cloud coverage for particular locations. © 2023, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","2-s2.0-85172212262"

We will examine how the six consistent design principles may assist us in ensuring that the finished product has the highest attainable quality in the shortest amount of time imaginable throughout the improvement interaction. Giving wonderful items quickly for what it's worth to accomplish as such successfully is equally important. There are several strategies we may employ to achieve this, such availability techniques, which enable us to retain the highest level of quality we are capable of as a software development team. Along with a few strategies for expediting product delivery and including a better driver software architecture in the driver software, he explains these strategies. A sizable portion of India's economy is focused on the food industry. The great majority of individuals in this area rely mostly on agricultural produce for their income, which benefits the whole community. The development of food, which is fundamental for human food, is heavily influenced by ranchers. The sales reps are attempting to decide the right selling cost for the offers they are giving. The misfortunes of this organization outperform its benefits. As indicated by the financial exchange hypothesis referenced above, ranchers are allowed to sell their wares at the most elevated offer cost. Ranchers that sign up in this manner will approach different administrations, including assessments, distributer correspondence, market warnings, and different elements and benefits of a comparable kind. Predictive analytics may be used in many other industries, such as expert device manufacture (which might include voice recognition and artificial vision), judicial assessment, and a number of others. Precision agriculture, automated weapons systems (such as drones), and judicial precedent analysis are a few examples. The adoption of artificial intelligence agricultural methods will help alleviate the challenge of the rising global food demand. Artificial intelligence would make it simple to identify and target weeds, and decisions on the use of pesticides and the appropriate buffer zone could be made quickly. It was chosen to include certain artificial intelligence (AI) components in this paper. © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85178255825"

Methods: We conducted a decade-long comprehensive search (January 2013–May 2023) of both academic and grey literature, focusing on the application of AI in ophthalmology and healthcare. This search included key web-based academic databases, non-traditional sources, and targeted searches of specific organizations and institutions. We reviewed and selected documents for relevance to AI, healthcare, ethics, and guidelines, aiming for a critical analysis of ethical, moral, and legal implications of AI in healthcare. Results: Six main issues were identified, analyzed, and discussed. These include bias and clinical safety, cybersecurity, health data and AI algorithm ownership, the “black-box” problem, medical liability, and the risk of widening inequality in healthcare. Conclusion: Solutions to address these issues include collecting high-quality data of the target population, incorporating stronger security measures, using explainable AI algorithms and ensemble methods, and making AI-based solutions accessible to everyone.

The offshore industry uses substantial amounts of steel, and current practices for handling these assets are often not transparent, leading to criticism for unsustainable and non-compliant scrapping procedures. The presented approach combines engineering and technical data from offshore assets with decommissioning best practices and digital and Al technologies to ensure a transparent and ESG-compliant approach to scrapping. This will provide auditable evidence of ESG compliance and is expected to address the challenge of managing end-of-life offshore assetswhile providing sustainable metals alternatives for heavy industry. The use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) requires asset owners to demonstrate compliance with net zero targets, which is mainly impacted by the main material groups, such as steel. Recycled steel maintains its strength properties and if produced using electric arc furnaces and transported efficiently emissions can be minimized. The implemented solution offers a transparent, reliable, and ESG-optimized approach for scrapping assets. Each step in the process, from cutting to transportation to the metals furnace, can be tracked and audited, ensuring the end-product can be classified as 'green' steel. This steel can be used by asset owners to construct new vessels or facilities or can be sold to other users, creating a true circular economy where a significant amount of embodied carbon can be recycled and made net zero. The use of advanced digital technologies in the offshore industry's scrapping and recycling process allows for a more transparent and sustainable approach. The procedure includes verification of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) parameters and information on carbon emissions, enabling the selection of the most environmentally friendly approach. This can provide transparency and stability in sourcing, ensure ESG compliance, and result in competitive pricing. Integrating the use of recycled metals, which has significantly lower emissions compared to non-recycled metals, can further decrease resource consumption and emissions while increasing the value of recycled by-products. Under this industrial study, up to 4.3 tons of CO2 can be saved for each ton of recycled stainless-steel scrap utilized. Furthermore, the breakdown of emissions in terms of handling, transportation and operations are illustrated in depth with validated emission factors. The solution can be expanded to cover a variety of materials and assets, both offshore and onshore, to give asset owners peace of mind regarding their ESG responsibilities in the scrapping and construction value chain. This will provide a smooth, transparent, and efficient turnkey solution. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers.","2-s2.0-85176724774"

This development has enabled, more than ever, novel applications in real industrial systems. However, the desire to achieve quick results has led to decentralized and unstable applications that can hinder the long-term scalability and maintenance of these technologies. Moreover, the proliferation of commercial tools in response to the industry's demand for digital transformation has made selecting the right solution a daunting task. To address these challenges, Petrobras developed the SmartMonitor platform. SmartMonitor empowers users to create and configure, usually within minutes, online machine learning and first-principles monitoring tasks using a user-friendly, no-code visual programming framework. This approach ensures accessibility and democratizes the process of task creation and management. Additionally, the platform supports the inclusion of new methodologies and monitoring techniques, making it an integrated development hub aligned with best practices in machine learning models management. Currently, SmartMonitor has hundreds of tasks running in real-time, generating performance indices on critical equipment in Petrobras units.

Moreover, the IF game-based construction procedure requires much less human interventions than previous ones. Different from existing benchmarks, our dataset focuses on the assessment of functional commonsense knowledge rules rather than factual knowledge. Hence, in order to achieve higher performance on our tasks, models need to effectively utilize such functional knowledge to infer the outcomes of actions, rather than relying solely on memorizing facts.

Our primary preventive health intervention, called the Saathealth family health interventions, is a scaled digital offering that aims to improve knowledge levels on various health topics, nudge positive behaviour changes, and drive improved health outcomes. This case study presents our learnings and best practices in scaling these digital health interventions in resource-limited settings and maximising their impact. We scaled the Saathealth interventions to cumulatively reach >10 million users across India using a multi-pronged approach: (1) ensuring localization and cultural relevance of the health content delivered through user research; (2) disseminating content using omni-channel approaches, which involved using diverse content types and multiple digital platforms; (3) using iterative product features such as gamification and artificial intelligence-based (AI-based) predictive models; (4) using real-time analytics to adapt the user's digital experience by using interactive content to drive them towards products and services and (5) experiments with sustainability models to yield some early successes. The Saathealth family health mobile app had >25,000 downloads and the intervention reached >873,000 users in India every month through the mobile app, Facebook, and Instagram combined, from the time period of February 2022 to January 2023. We repeatedly observed videos and quizzes to be the most popular content types across all digital channels being used. Our AI-based predictive models helped improve user retention and content consumption, contributing to the sustainability of the mobile apps. In addition to reaching a high number of users across India, our scaling strategies contributed to deepened engagement and improved health-seeking behaviour.

This research begins by identifying the limitations of existing ethical AI development frameworks in performing requirements engineering(RE) processes during the development of trustworthy AI. Recommendations to address those limitations will be proposed to make the frameworks more applicable in the RE process to foster the development of trustworthy AI. This could lead to wider adoption, greater productivity of the AI systems, and reduced workload on humans for non-cognitive tasks.

Proactive mHealth is to predict and prevent a situation beforehand, promptly. Most health decisions are taken by the user pervasively. They have a short or long-term impact. Being proactive requires support as ubiquitous decision-making is prone to sudden changes. Changes in users’ internal and contextual states require adaptive systems with timeliness. Personalized health information needs analysis to support user-level decision-making. The goal is to automate processes and augment healthy behaviour. Data from wearables, together with the context, requires automated decision-making with AI modelling, for predicting intervention values. Prediction and prevention mechanism in implementation requires timely interventions, triggered with a supportive action. The health information (wearables + context) can provide information about the states (current, future, and goal). AI-enabled proactive mHealth framework accentuates abstraction by presenting modules with rules of user-level decision-making, tools for automated decision-making, design with P5 principles, and the architecture of Just-in-time adaptive interventions. In this paper, a proof-of-concept (POC) for health promotion with physical activity is implemented based on the framework. The goal is to promote health with motivation.

The paper provides a step-by-step approach to implementing the system on the framework, from input/output mapping to modelling.

Yet, one disadvantage is that the large majority of approaches directly target to signal the disease without considering at all the running protocols or medical guidelines used by clinicians. We address here the gap between running clinical protocols and solutions provided by computer scientists. Instead of directly target the disease, we aim the identify only the biomarkers that the physicians are looking for. We apply this approach to the age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The task is to identify biomarkers for the AMD condition by segmenting retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. One relevant question regards the choice between feature based techniques versus deep learning methods. We address this question by providing a hybrid original solution that combines deep learning based retinal layer segmentation with feature based image classification used to distinguish between a particular fluid area and its neighbouring retinal areas. In this context we perform a comparative analysis of various semantic segmentation techniques which provide noticeable results for retinal layer segmentation. On the other hand, due to the low representation of some fluids in the considered benchmark dataset, we address and enhance their recognition by texture based region of interest classification.

Millions of people have become sick and thousands have died due to the respiratory illness caused by the virus. The virus is known to spread when small droplets from nose or mouth of an infected person gets dissolved in air when he or she coughs or exhales or when a person touches a surface infected with virus. The governments all over the world are working on ways to curb the spread of this virus. Multidisciplinary researchers are working to find the best solutions in their own way. Out of the many solutions wearing surgical facemasks is being one of the best preventive measures to limit the spread of corona virus. These masks support filtration of air and adequate breathability. But the problem is that few people don’t use the masks regularly or occasionally due to various reasons like negligence and discomfort etc. This is one of the main causes of high spread of COVID. So, there is a strong need to detect people without mask at public places and to aware them. There are so many initiatives taken by government in this direction, but all have their limitation in one or the other way. So, there is a strong need of a digital solution to ensure that people comply with the government rules of wearing masks in public place sand to recognize unmasked faces on existing monitoring systems to maintain safety and security. Facial recognition systems were being used to identify faces using technology that includes hardware like video cameras. These systems work by combining AI based pattern recognition system along with biometrics to map facial features from an image and compare it with a database of known faces. This research content is also an initiative in this direction to optimize the results. © 2023, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","2-s2.0-85169674950"

AI-based systems aim to improve the efficacy of clinical tasks, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and tailoring treatment delivery. As it becomes increasingly prevalent in health care for high-quality patient care, it is critical for health care providers to use the systems responsibly to mitigate bias, ensure effective outcomes, and provide safe clinical practices. In this study, the clinical task is the identification of heart failure (HF) prior to surgery with the intention of enhancing clinical decision-making skills. HF is a common and severe disease, but detection remains challenging due to its subtle manifestation, often concurrent with other medical conditions, and the absence of a simple and effective diagnostic test. While advanced HF algorithms have been developed, the use of these AI-based systems to enhance clinical decision-making in medical education remains understudied. Objective: This research protocol is to demonstrate our study design, systematic procedures for selecting surgical cases from electronic health records, and interventions. The primary objective of this study is to measure the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving HF recognition before surgery, the second objective is to evaluate the impact of inaccurate AI recommendations, and the third objective is to explore the relationship between the inclination to accept AI recommendations and their accuracy. Methods: Our study used a 3 × 2 factorial design (intervention type × order of prepost sets) for this randomized trial with medical students. The student participants are asked to complete a 30-minute e-learning module that includes key information about the intervention and a 5-question quiz, and a 60-minute review of 20 surgical cases to determine the presence of HF. To mitigate selection bias in the pre- and posttests, we adopted a feature-based systematic sampling procedure. From a pool of 703 expert-reviewed surgical cases, 20 were selected based on features such as case complexity, model performance, and positive and negative labels. This study comprises three interventions: (1) a direct AI-based recommendation with a predicted HF score, (2) an indirect AI-based recommendation gauged through the area under the curve metric, and (3) an HF guideline-based intervention. Results: As of July 2023, 62 of the enrolled medical students have fulfilled this study’s participation, including the completion of a short quiz and the review of 20 surgical cases. The subject enrollment commenced in August 2022 and will end in December 2023, with the goal of recruiting 75 medical students in years 3 and 4 with clinical experience. Conclusions: We demonstrated a study protocol for the randomized trial, measuring the effectiveness of interventions using AI and HF guidelines among medical students to enhance HF recognition in preoperative care with electronic health record data.

Despite its innovative features, SmartVessel was limited in its analysis of operational situation on working site as it relies solely on images, lacking temporal context. This deficiency leads to numerous false alarms and unnecessary operations interruptions. To address this issue, the new version of AI solution called SmartVessel-v2 was proposed. Despite the large number of advances, the main one can be called features tracking capabilities and temporal modeling. The brand-new version promises higher accuracy and efficiency, less false alarms and at higher running speed, increasing the safety of workers on-site. The goal of this paper is to present the recent advances of previously presented AI based HSE surveillance system. The paper covers new safety related business cases introduced in the solution and corresponding novel algorithms to process and analyze them. It also highlights overall advances of AI pipeline helped to achieve higher level of accuracy and outstanding reduction in number of false alarms.

However, deploying such systems in the field for use by a rig crew requires careful planning and execution and often fails to provide the value proposed. It is statistically estimated that most AI projects fail, and that most companies that trial AI solutions report minimal to no impact from AI. This paper details the successful deployment and ongoing success of an AI-based drilling advisory system on rigs across an Operator's fleet, as well as deployment decisions that helped make it a high-value, sustainable, and successful program. The Operator developing and deploying the AI system focused on five main aspects to anchor this project: setting a realistic long-term vision for automation, choosing the right tools and techniques, implementing a targeted change management plan, careful selection of team members, and planning for sustained management support. For the longer-term automation vision, decisions on where to deploy the AI models - at the rig or managed from the central office, what parts of the solution to develop in-house or out-source to achieve cost objectives, and how soon to scale AI to all rigs in the fleet were key. Finally, a thoughtful change management plan was implemented taking into consideration the company culture and industry best practices. The project launched in 2015, with the decision to deploy the AI models at the edge/rig site with an ability to push updates from a remote, central support group as needed. The AI model platform was outsourced; AI models were developed/validated one model at a time, and then deployed to all the rigs as soon as possible. The platform and models were modularized to enable rapid prototyping, field deployment, and iterative change. A key Program Sponsor along with other Stakeholders were identified for each rig, and carefully managed to ensure ongoing support, successful adoption, and regular feedback. Transparency on how the model performed calculations was shared readily to ensure acceptance of the results by the drilling engineers and the rig site crew. An agile development and deployment cycle was adopted to maintain rig crew interest to continuously use and improve the system. Over the past eight (8) years, more than ten (10) AI models have been added incrementally to the rig-based system, which has enabled a 10% improvement in drilling performance year over year. This paper details the decisions and processes that resulted in the successful deployment of an AI-based drilling advisory system for rigs in North America and Europe.

This chapter focuses on AI-based algorithms and tools that can be used to inform clinical decision-making for prevention or early detection of adverse drug events at the point of care. This overview addresses three types of AI: rule-based models which are currently used in practice; the next generation of more complex, modern machine learning; and natural language processing-based tools that are under development and in testing. Examples are given of the current rules-based systems that are widely used to support medication-related decision-making are summarized; these use clinical guidelines, patient-specific information such as comorbidities or genomic profiles, and known contraindications from pharmacological databases. The next generation of AI tools that use Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to inform medication-related decision-making are reviewed and there is a brief introduction of the currently limited scope of NLP being applied to extract information from free-text clinical notes in the electronic health record. The current challenges that are limiting the implementation of AI within this field are identified and suggestions for the future direction of AI that will affect clinical decision-making and patient outcomes are given. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Consequently, since 2019, the number of cases in the Judiciary involving AI has increased. Cases involving facial recognition systems (FRS) for contracting bank credit are increasing annually, so it is necessary to analyze how the Judiciary handles the issues. Problem: Why is the São Paulo Court of Appeal ruling in favor of banks in all cases involving taking out credit through facial recognition technology? Methodology and Methods: Data were collected and processed using automated computer programs. The qualitative analysis used the analytical, comparative and monographic methods. Results: The Court of Appeal of São Paulo considers it difficult to deceive an AI system, therefore, the burden of proof is on the author, even if there is a consumer relationship. That is, the decisions are contrary to the general rule of the Code of Consumer Protection in Brazil, which consists of reversing the burden of proof in consumer relations when one of the parties is underprivileged. Contributions and Solutions: The research points to the path of jurisprudence in cases involving the contracting of credit through FRS, and the Judiciary is deciding against the bank’s customers, dispensing with the production of evidence by the banking sector. Therefore, it is necessary to alert the National Council of Justice and the Central Bank regarding this situation so that it is disciplined adequately since the FRS is fallible and does not guarantee the absence of fraud. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","2-s2.0-85175789467"

The AIA adopts a risk-based approach with the aim of intending to regulate AI systems, especially categorised as high-risk, which have significant harmful impacts on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons in the Union. The AIA is founded on the Ethics Guidelines of the High-Level Expert Group for Trustworthy AI, which are grounded in fundamental rights and reflect four ethical imperatives in order to ensure ethical and robust AI. While we acknowledge that ethics is not law, we advocate that the analysis of ethical risks can assist us in complying with laws, thereby facilitating the implementation of the AIA requirements. Thus, we first design an AI-driven Decision Support System for individual risk prediction in the insurance domain (categorised as high-risk by the AIA) based on the Titanic case, which is a popular benchmark dataset in machine learning. We then fulfill an ethical impact assessment of the Titanic case study, relying on the four ethical imperatives of respect for human autonomy, prevention of harm, fairness, and explicability, declared by the High-Level Expert Group for Trustworthy AI. In the context of this ethical impact assessment, we also refer to the questions in the ALTAI checklist. Our discussions regarding the ethical impact assessment in the insurance domain demonstrate that ethical principles can intersect but also create tensions (intriguingly, only in this particular context), for which there is no definitive solution. When tensions arise, which may result in unavoidable trade-offs, these trade-offs should be addressed in a rational and methodical manner, paying special attention to the context of the current case study being evaluated. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

We propose a multilingual Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) technique that orders potential responses based on the distance between the question s text embeddings and the answer s graph embeddings. A system incorporating this novel method is also described in our work. Through comprehensive experimentation using various English and multilingual datasets and two KGs-Freebase andWikidata-we illustrate the comparative advantage of the proposed method across diverse KG embeddings and languages.

This practice force developers to release immature products, neglecting best practices to reduce delivery times. As a possible result, technical debt can arise, i.e., potential design issues that can negatively impact software maintenance and evolution and, in turn, increase both the time-To-market and costs. Code smells-sub-optimal design decisions identifiable by computing software metrics and providing a general overview of code quality-Are common symptoms of technical debt. While previous research focused on code smells primarily considering them in the context of Java, the growing popularity of Python, particularly for developing artificial intelligence (AI)-Enabled systems, calls for additional investigations. This preliminary analysis addresses this gap by exploring the diffusion of Python-specific code smells, and the activities performed by developers that induce the introduction of code smells in their systems. To perform our preliminary investigation, we selected 200 AI-Enabled systems available in the Niche dataset; We extracted 10,611 information on the releases using PyDriller, and PySmell to extract information about code smells. The results reveal several insights: 1) Code smells related to object-oriented principles are rarely detected in Python; 2) Complex List Comprehension is the most prevalent and the most long-Alive smell; 3) The main activities that can induce code smells are evolutionary. This study fills a critical gap in the literature by providing empirical evidence on the evolution of code smells in Python-based AI-enabled systems. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","2-s2.0-85177040669"

This research attempts to bridge a gap in current understanding and provide insights for assisting users in comprehending the rule-based system’s reasoning through dialogue. The hypothesis is that employing dialogue as a mechanism can be effective in constructing explanations. A dialogue framework for rule-based AI systems is presented, allowing the system to explain its decisions by engaging in “Why?” and “Why not?” questions and answers.

The environmental crisis caused due to global warming and the depletion of oil supplies are factors that have made the automobile sector adopt strategies to produce eco-friendly, sustainable vehicles instead of their commercial fuel propelled vehicles. Most governments have expressed their interest in alleviating the environmental impact caused due to vehicle pollution by introducing various policies that eventually help people switch to Electric Vehicles (EV). Though there has been a surge of interest among people to adopt environmentally friendly, economically affordable electric vehicles, the major concern is the state of charge and range offered by these EVs. The global automobile sector has started to invest in research dedicated to the energy management system in EVs to overcome these issues. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and the advancement of control systems are clear signs for developing smart-energy management systems in EV.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) hold promise in improving diagnostics. Thus, we performed a systematic review of literature to identify the utility of AI/ML in the diagnosis or classification of PCOS. Methods: We applied a search strategy using the following databases MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Web of Science, and the IEEE Xplore Digital Library using relevant keywords. Eligible studies were identified, and results were extracted for their synthesis from inception until January 1, 2022. Results: 135 studies were screened and ultimately, 31 studies were included in this study. Data sources used by the AI/ML interventions included clinical data, electronic health records, and genetic and proteomic data. Ten studies (32%) employed standardized criteria (NIH, Rotterdam, or Revised International PCOS classification), while 17 (55%) used clinical information with/without imaging. The most common AI techniques employed were support vector machine (42% studies), K-nearest neighbor (26%), and regression models (23%) were the commonest AI/ML. Receiver operating curves (ROC) were employed to compare AI/ML with clinical diagnosis. Area under the ROC ranged from 73% to 100% (n=7 studies), diagnostic accuracy from 89% to 100% (n=4 studies), sensitivity from 41% to 100% (n=10 studies), specificity from 75% to 100% (n=10 studies), positive predictive value (PPV) from 68% to 95% (n=4 studies), and negative predictive value (NPV) from 94% to 99% (n=2 studies). Conclusion: Artificial intelligence and machine learning provide a high diagnostic and classification performance in detecting PCOS, thereby providing an avenue for early diagnosis of this disorder. However, AI-based studies should use standardized PCOS diagnostic criteria to enhance the clinical applicability of AI/ML in PCOS and improve adherence to methodological and reporting guidelines for maximum diagnostic utility.

More specifically, our novel framework places stakeholders’ (patients, health care professionals, industry, and government institutions) safety at its core by asking developers to demonstrate the biological-psychological (impact on physical and mental health), economic, and social value of their AI tool before it is launched. We also introduce a novel cost-effective, time-sensitive, and safety-oriented mixed quantitative and qualitative clinical phased trial approach to help industry and government health care regulatory agencies test and deliberate on whether to launch these AI-based medical technologies. To our knowledge, our biological-psychological, economic, and social (BPES) framework and mixed method phased trial approach are the first to place the Hippocratic Oath of “Do No Harm” at the center of developers’, implementers’, regulators’, and users’ mindsets when determining whether an AI-based medical technology is safe to launch.

We conclude that the implementation of AI and mHealth apps for routine clinical practice and remote health care will not be feasible until we overcome the main challenges regarding data privacy and security, quality assessment, and the reproducibility and uncertainty of AI results. Moreover, there is a lack of both standardized methods to measure the clinical outcomes of mHealth apps and techniques to encourage user engagement and behavior changes in the long term. We expect that in the near future, these obstacles will be overcome and that the ongoing European project, Watching the risk factors (WARIFA), will provide considerable advances in the implementation of AI-based mHealth apps for disease prevention and health promotion. © Alejandro Deniz-Garcia, Himar Fabelo, Antonio J Rodriguez-Almeida, Garlene Zamora-Zamorano, Maria Castro-Fernandez, Maria del Pino Alberiche Ruano, Terje Solvoll, Conceição Granja, Thomas Roger Schopf, Gustavo M Callico, Cristina Soguero-Ruiz, Ana M Wägner, WARIFA Consortium.

However, IoT devices have processing and power limitation. Thus, security remains one of the main challenges. Software-defined networking (SDN) helps traditional IoT infrastructure become manageable and flexible in a centralized fashion. The SDN-IoT architecture tackles the security issue of IoT networks. The proposed architecture adds a new security engine to the controller. The security engine consists of the monitoring, intelligent sub-layer, analyzing/detection engine, reaction, and config engine to automatically monitor, analyze, classify, detect, and generate a proper reaction to the possible threads in two phases. The config engine automatically rearranges the security rules and applies the set of rules as a new configuration to the devices (switches) in the data layer. The intelligent sub-layer uses AI-based feature selection (Bat Algorithm) and classification (Random Forest) algorithms to reveal the possible threats and forward its output to the analyzing/detecting engine to examine it and make the alerts. The cooperation of the intelligent sub-layer and analyzing/detection engine in the two mentioned steps help the system improve the overall system performance and false positive alerts. The proposed architecture follows new security rules based on the network status such as bandwidth minimization and traffic. All the process automatically makes by the security engine and protects the entire network from different threats and attacks.  © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85166376773"

We present empirical insights from three cases involving a typical Chinese manufacturing firm engaged in AI-driven iterative product innovation. We followed our sample firm for 12 months, relying on interviews, observations, and external archival data to collect rich data about its innovation process, and conducted text coding and text analytics to gain insights into the data. Our findings reveal that AI provides opportunities for broad, deep, and agile stakeholder interactions with the support of AI-enabled interactive digital platforms, intelligent manufacturing, and intelligent machines. During this process, risks emerge around data leakage, over-reliance on online intelligence decision-making, and unpredictable AI behaviors. Manufacturing firms need to manage AI by focusing on key principles relating to formulating guidelines for data management, integrating offline decision-makers&#x2019; experience into online intelligence analysis, and establishing management standards for intelligent devices.

Its remarkable performance in numerous applications has also attracted researchers' attention, prompting investigations into the potential utility of this AI-tool to enhance scientific work. The current paper aims to present a succinct overview of the opportunities and challenges of using ChatGPT in educational research based on the anticipations and analysis of scholars from different fields of research. Practical implications - ChatGPT is a double-edged sword with its potential benefits and caveats for scientific research. Educational researchers could benefit from the utility of ChatGPT in identifying gaps in the literature, generating new ideas and developing hypothesis, devising surveys or rating scales, conducting systematic reviews, eliminating human error in analysis of large datasets as well as drafting and editing scientific manuscripts. On the other hand, the current limitations of ChatGPT in enabling a reliable and transparent generation of content, its inability to provide accurate references or tendency to suggest non-existent resources, and incompatibility with the current ethical and legal obligations of academic publishing warrants cautious and meticulous endeavor of educational researchers. Conclusion - The current era has witnessed groundbreaking advancements in AI-based technologies, which will for sure act as precursor for the development of more-developed AI-systems that could overcome the recent shortcomings of ChatGPT in aiding scientific research. Till then, scientists working in the education field should continue striving to understand its potential to advance any aspect of their scientific quest, and collaborate to formulate guidelines and principles to enable the ethical and responsible integration of these new technologies into scientific research and publishing.  © 2023 by the author(s).","2-s2.0-85164985027"

Monitoring large traffic volumes physically and tracking violations at the same time is clearly insufficient with only physical traffic police. The result has been that many violators have gone undetected. By violating the traffic laws, the violators cause more serious mishaps on the road, thereby putting both themselves and others in danger. To avoid manual intervention in detecting and catching violators, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based techniques should be incorporated. This research study demonstrates a novel technique to discover multiple offences on Indian roads electronically, which include helmet detection, using a smartphone while driving, tri cruising, wheeling, and parking illegally, and ultimately model the issuing of tickets by monitoring the infractions and affiliated car number together in record.

To accomplish this, we used ChatGPT to reformulate the STROBE recommendations into a list of questions to be answered by the transformer itself. We then qualitatively evaluated the coherence and relevance of the transformer’s outputs. Study design: Descriptive study. Methods: We first chose a study to be used as a basis for the simulation. We then used ChatGPT to transform each STROBE checklist’s item into specific prompts. Each answer to the respective prompt was evaluated by independent researchers in terms of coherence and relevance. Results: The mean scores assigned to each prompt were heterogeneous. On average, for the coherence domain, the overall mean score was 3.6 out of 5.0, and for relevance it was 3.3 out of 5.0. The lowest scores were assigned to items belonging to the Methods section of the checklist. Conclusions: ChatGPT can be considered as a valuable support for researchers in conducting an epidemiological study, following internationally recognized guidelines and standards.

It underlines that the ethical guidelines and the existing laws which are applicable to AI systems were not considered by the Commission to be sufficient to address the risks posed by the development and deployment of AI. Therefore, the legislative framework should be improved by adjusting or clarifying existing legislation. Alongside the possible adjustments to and clarifications of existing legislation, the Commission considered that a new legislation specifically on artificial intelligence was needed to make the EU legal framework fit for the current and forthcoming technological and commercial developments. The White Paper on AI reaffirmed that “AI should work for people and be a force for good in society”, set out the Commission’s vision of advancing as well as regulating AI, confirmed that a new regulatory framework on AI will be adopted, and offered specific insights about the core elements of the forthcoming new AI regime. The guiding principles of the White Paper are the creation of ecosystems of excellence (“the Policy Framework”) and of trust (“the Regulatory Framework”). Although the White Paper on AI did not set out a concrete framework for new AI legislation, it did set out the Commission’s key priorities in that regard. A new regulatory framework specifically for AI (“effective” and “not excessively prescriptive”) was considered to be necessary, following a risk-based approach, ensuring that the regulatory intervention is proportionate and sufficiently flexible to accommodate technological progress while also precise enough to provide legal certainty. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85164712323"

Statistical learning, a generalized framework from machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) is predestined for processing ""Big Data""and holds the potential to revolutionize the field of laboratory medicine. Personalized medicine may in particular benefit from AI-based systems, especially when coupled with readily available wearables and smartphones which can collect health data from individual patients and offer new, cost-effective access routes to healthcare for patients worldwide. The amount of personal data collected, however, also raises concerns about patient-privacy and calls for clear ethical guidelines for ""Big Data""research, including rigorous quality checks of data and algorithms to eliminate underlying bias and enable transparency. Likewise, novel federated privacy-preserving data processing approaches may reduce the need for centralized data storage. Generative AI-systems including large language models such as ChatGPT currently enter the stage to reshape clinical research, clinical decision-support systems, and healthcare delivery. In our opinion, AI-based systems have a tremendous potential to transform laboratory medicine, however, their opportunities should be weighed against the risks carefully.

This paper briefly examines the current state of AI-enabled applications and discusses the various risk containment strategies being implemented. Initial efforts focused on establishing high-level principles for responsible AI use. More recent strategies have sought to operationalize these principles through normative instruments, such as industry best practices and legal statutes, that govern AI applications and their creators. While valuable, such a top-down approach is not sufficiently effective; a complementary, bottom-up approach focused on strengthening the environment in which AI is deployed is also necessary. The paper analyzes two specific initiatives aimed at enhancing the human component of AI deployment (creating a better-informed public through AI benchmarks, creating a better-equipped public with resources for local validation) and offers insights on how this environment-focused track can contribute to risk containment. Furthermore, we suggest additional steps for leveraging this approach in tandem with top-down strategies to cultivate a more robust risk mitigation framework. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Hence, the algorithms must take into account many constraints and are influenced by several varying factors such as other vessels, weather, etc. The objective of this paper is to propose a model that provides the reason behind the ASV’s decision when it is on a predefined path and changes speed or route. Fuzzy logic is used to record the expert knowledge based on COLREGs to steer the vessel and take the decision during the collision course. Data has been captured based on expert knowledge and used to train an explainable model. The explainable model predicts the reason behind the decision. The focus of the paper is on local explainability instead of global decisions. The structured abstracts of the paper are (1) Background: Several AI-enabled algorithms have been proposed for implementing autonomy to avoid the collision. These black-box techniques provide good predictions at the same time, they fail to explain the reason behind the decision, which makes the model less trustworthy; (2) Methods: Expert knowledge (COLREGs) has been captured using fuzzy rules and applied when ASV progresses, the decision has been recorded. (3) Results: The explainable model provides the reason behind the action taken by the collision avoidance system; (4) Conclusion: A model has been proposed that explains the collision avoidance system to make it transparent and trustworthy. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","2-s2.0-85164724139"

These techniques have been applied to various areas such as image reconstruction, denoising, detecting and removing artifacts, segmentation, tissue microstructure modeling, brain connectivity analysis, and diagnosis support. State-of-the-art AI algorithms have the potential to leverage optimization techniques in dMRI to advance sensitivity and inference through biophysical models. While the use of AI in brain microstructures has the potential to revolutionize the way we study the brain and understand brain disorders, we need to be aware of the pitfalls and emerging best practices that can further advance this field. Additionally, since dMRI scans rely on sampling of the q-space geometry, it leaves room for creativity in data engineering in such a way that it maximizes the prior inference. Utilization of the inherent geometry has been shown to improve general inference quality and might be more reliable in identifying pathological differences. We acknowledge and classify AI-based approaches for dMRI using these unifying characteristics. This article also highlighted and reviewed general practices and pitfalls involving tissue microstructure estimation through data-driven techniques and provided directions for building on them.

The article investigates how the EU as a multi-level system aims at regulating military AI based on epistemic authority. It suggests that the EU acts as a rule-maker and a rule-taker of military AI predicated on constructing private, corporate actors as experts. As a rule-maker, the EU has set up expert panels such as the Global Tech Panel to inform its initiatives, thereby inviting corporate actors to become part of its decision-making process through the front-door. But the EU is also a rule-taker in that its approach to regulating on military AI is shaped through the backdoor by how corporate actors design AI technologies. These observations signal an emerging hybrid regulatory security state based on ‘liquid’ forms of epistemic authority that empowers corporate actors but also denotes a complex mix of formal political and informal expert authority. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-85147435827"

This article focuses on the practical case study of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) to provide a guideline for employing AI in the process. Design/methodology/approach: Researchers no longer require technical skills to use AI in their research. The recent discussion about using Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), a chatbot by OpenAI, has reached the academic world and fueled heated debates about the future of academic research. Nevertheless, as the saying goes, AI will not replace our job; a human being using AI will. This editorial aims to provide an overview of the current state of using AI in research, highlighting recent trends and developments in the field. Findings: The main result is guidelines for the use of AI in the scientific research process. The guidelines were developed for the literature review case but the authors believe the instructions provided can be adjusted to many fields of research, including but not limited to quantitative research, data qualification, research on unstructured data, qualitative data and even on many support functions and repetitive tasks. Originality/value: AI already has the potential to make researchers’ work faster, more reliable and more convenient. The authors highlight the advantages and limitations of AI in the current time, which should be present in any research utilizing AI. Advantages include objectivity and repeatability in research processes that currently are subject to human error. The most substantial disadvantages lie in the architecture of current general-purpose models, which understanding is essential for using them in research. The authors will describe the most critical shortcomings without going into technical detail and suggest how to work with the shortcomings daily. © 2023, Bastian Burger, Dominik K.

Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and intervention characteristics of AI chatbots for promoting health behavior change. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in 7 bibliographic databases (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Embase, and JMIR publications) for empirical articles published from 1980 to 2022 that evaluated the feasibility or efficacy of AI chatbots for behavior change. The screening, extraction, and analysis of the identified articles were performed by following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Results: Of the 15 included studies, several demonstrated the high efficacy of AI chatbots in promoting healthy lifestyles (n=6, 40%), smoking cessation (n=4, 27%), treatment or medication adherence (n=2, 13%), and reduction in substance misuse (n=1, 7%). However, there were mixed results regarding feasibility, acceptability, and usability. Selected behavior change theories and expert consultation were used to develop the behavior change strategies of AI chatbots, including goal setting, monitoring, real-time reinforcement or feedback, and on-demand support. Real-time user-chatbot interaction data, such as user preferences and behavioral performance, were collected on the chatbot platform to identify ways of providing personalized services. The AI chatbots demonstrated potential for scalability by deployment through accessible devices and platforms (eg, smartphones and Facebook Messenger). The participants also reported that AI chatbots offered a nonjudgmental space for communicating sensitive information. However, the reported results need to be interpreted with caution because of the moderate to high risk of internal validity, insufficient description of AI techniques, and limitation for generalizability. Conclusions: AI chatbots have demonstrated the efficacy of health behavior change interventions among large and diverse populations; however, future studies need to adopt robust randomized control trials to establish definitive conclusions. © Abhishek Aggarwal, Cheuk Chi Tam, Dezhi Wu, Xiaoming Li, Shan Qiao.","2-s2.0-85148964799"

Research on ID becomes important when authors’ written online communication pertains to sensitive domains, e.g., mental health. Over time, researchers have utilized AI-based automated word spinners (e.g., SpinRewriter, WordAI) for paraphrasing content. However, these tools fail to satisfy the purpose of ID as their paraphrased content still leads to the source when queried on search engines. There is limited prior work on judging the effectiveness of paraphrasing methods for ID on search engines or their proxies, neural retriever (NeurIR) models. We propose a framework where, for a given sentence from an author’s post, we perform iterative perturbation on the sentence in the direction of paraphrasing with an attempt to confuse the search mechanism of a NeurIR system when the sentence is queried on it. Our experiments involve the subreddit “r/AmItheAsshole” as the source of public content and Dense Passage Retriever as a NeurIR system-based proxy for search engines. Our work introduces a novel method of phrase-importance rankings using perplexity scores and involves multi-level phrase substitutions via beam search. Our multi-phrase substitution scheme succeeds in disguising sentences 82% of the time and hence takes an essential step towards enabling researchers to disguise sensitive content effectively before making it public. We also release the code of our approach.

A successful use of AI depends on the attitude and perception of medical experts of its applications. Objective: To evaluate physicians and medical students’ attitude and perception on AI applications in healthcare. Method: A web-based survey was disseminated by email to physicians and medical students. Results: A total of 293 (82 physicians and 211 medical students) individuals have participated (response rate is 27%). Seven participants (9%) reported knowing nothing about AI, while 208 (69%) were aware that it is an emerging field and would like to learn about it. Concerns about AI impact on physicians’ employability were not prominent. Instead, the majority (n=159) agreed that new positions will be created and the job market for those who embrace AI will increase. They reported willingness to adapt AI in practice if it was incorporated in international guidelines (30.5%), published in respected scientific journals (17.1%), or included in formal training (12.2%). Almost two of the three participants agreed that dedicated courses will help them to implement AI. The most commonly reported problem of AI is its inability to provide opinions in unexpected scenarios. Half of the participants think that both the manufacturer and physicians should be legally liable for medical errors occur due to AI-based decision support tools while more than one-third (36.77%) think that physicians who make the final decision should be legally liable. Senior physicians were found to be less familiar with AI and more concerned about physicians’ legal liability in case of a medical error. Conclusion: Physicians and medical students showed positive attitudes and willingness to learn about AI applications in healthcare. Introducing AI learning objectives or short courses in medical curriculum would help to equip physicians with the needed skills for AI-augmented healthcare system. © The Author(s) 2023.","2-s2.0-85147168720"

Unfortunately, several cases of discrimination by AI systems have already been reported. Scholars have warned on risks of AI reproducing existing inequalities or even amplifying them. To tackle these risks and promote responsible AI, many ethics guidelines for AI have emerged recently, including diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) principles and practices. However, little is known about the DEI content of these guidelines, and to what extent they meet the most relevant accumulated knowledge from DEI literature. We performed a semi-systematic literature review of the AI guidelines regarding DEI stakes and analyzed 46 guidelines published from 2015 to today. We fleshed out the 14 DEI principles and the 18 DEI practices recommended underlying these 46 guidelines. We found that the guidelines mostly encourage one of the DEI management paradigms, namely fairness, justice, and nondiscrimination, in a limited compliance approach. We found that narrow technical practices are favored over holistic ones. Finally, we conclude that recommended practices for implementing DEI principles in AI should include actions aimed at directly influencing AI actors’ behaviors and awareness of DEI risks, rather than just stating intentions and programs. © 2023 The Author(s).

The transition from the earlier rule-based approach in expert systems to today’s data-centric approach in machine learning (ML) and deep learning has drastically altered the implementation scenario of many AI-based applications. MYCIN was a rule-based expert system that we used in the past to detect bacteria causing disease. In today’s AI, however, machine learning and deep learning-based technologies are frequently used in the health care industry. When there is enough data in the relevant domain, data-centric machine learning algorithms perform well. Some of the notable applications of AI in the health care industry are disease identification, outbreak prediction, drug development, smart health records, and so on. In this paper, we have investigated the role of ML in liver disease identification. The human liver is regarded as the most fundamentally functioning body organ, aiding in the digestion of food and removing poisonous compounds. A later diagnosis of liver illness will result in a life-threatening condition that will shorten a person’s life. Machine learning can be used to fully assess the aspects of liver disease and forecast its severity. We used ML-based models KNN and SVM to identify liver disease in patients by selecting relevant features from the Indian liver patient dataset. Classification has been done by tuning different hyper parameters of the models, and some useful conclusions have been drawn at last. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","2-s2.0-85161203505"

Although it offers advantages in automating and facilitating design tasks, this technology has constraints to empowering practitioners. AI systems steadily incorporate machine learning to deliver meaningful designs but fail in critical dimensions such as creativity. Moreover, the intensive use of AI features to provide a design solution – so-called AI design – challenges the boundaries of the design field and designers’ roles. AI-powered logo makers exemplify a horizon where non-designers can access design tools to create a personal or business visual identity. However, in the current context, these online businesses are limited to randomize layout solutions lacking the visual properties a logo requires. This article reports mixed-method research focusing on AI-powered logo makers’ processes and outcomes. We investigated their capability to deliver consistent logo designs and to what extent their algorithms address logo design principles. Initially, our study identified representative visual principles in logo design-related literature. After probing AI-powered logo makers’ features that enable logo creation, we conducted an exploratory experiment to obtain solutions. Finally, we invited logo design experts to evaluate whether three visual principles (proportion, balance and unity) were incorporated into the layouts. The assessment’s results suggest that these AI design tools must calibrate the algorithms to provide solutions that meet expected logo design standards. Even focusing on a particular AI tool and a few visual principles, our research contributes to initial directions for developing algorithms that embody the complex aspects of visual design syntax. © The Author(s) 2023.","2-s2.0-85153367098"

However, AI systems may fail on the ground when they are not developed in collaboration with the experts they seek to bypass. This raises the question of how to manage the collaborative development of AI. Building on a comparative field study, we reveal three key challenges of collaborative AI development in the area of consulting, hiring, and radiology.

The proposed AI Act must be reviewed and adopted by the European Parliament and Member States before it comes into effect and, to this end, the Commission’s proposed AI Act is being discussed by the co-legislators (the main decision-making bodies of the EU), i.e., the European Parliament (“the Parliament”) and the Council of the European Union (“the Council”). This chapter compares the Commission’s proposed AI Act with the Council’s numerous “compromise” proposals (from November 2021 to December 2022) which attempted to find a common position between Member States. The Council’s AI Act final version (general approach) of 11 November 2022 received unanimous approval from the Committee of Permanent Representatives on 18 November 2022, and its formal adoption by EU ministers took place at the Telecom Council meeting on 6 December 2022. This chapter also takes into account the European Parliament’s views on all major and controversial issues, revealing the position the European Parliament is likely to adopt in the forthcoming negotiations with the Commission and the Council on the text of the AI Act. It covers the process of preparing the Parliament’s compromise proposal, taking account of the comments/amendments which were submitted by political groups represented in the European Parliament and which set the tone for future discussions and political negotiations in order to reach a majority via compromises. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85164711530"

The environment is represented as a set of logical propositions. The agent's knowledge base is expressed as a set of first-order logic rules describing the relationships between the propositions. The Minimax algorithm is used to generate a game tree and compute the minimax values of the nodes in the tree, allowing the agent to make informed decisions about which actions to take.

While there are chatbots that do not use artificial intelligence (AI), conversational chatbots integrate AI language models that allow for back-and-forth conversation between an AI system and a human user. GPT-3, since upgraded to GPT-4, harnesses a natural language processing technique called sentence embedding and allows for conversations with users that are more nuanced and realistic than before. The launch of this model came in the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, where increases in health care needs globally combined with social distancing measures made virtual medicine more relevant than ever. GPT-3 and other conversational models have been used for a wide variety of medical purposes, from providing basic COVID-19–related guidelines to personalized medical advice and even prescriptions. The line between medical professionals and conversational chatbots is somewhat blurred, notably in hard-to-reach communities where the chatbot replaced face-to-face health care. Considering these blurred lines and the circumstances accelerating the adoption of conversational chatbots globally, we analyze the use of these tools from an ethical perspective. Notably, we map out the many types of risks in the use of conversational chatbots in medicine to the principles of medical ethics. In doing so, we propose a framework for better understanding the effects of these chatbots on both patients and the medical field more broadly, with the hope of informing safe and appropriate future developments. © Eleonore Fournier-Tombs, Juliette McHardy.","2-s2.0-85165788275"

Once the additional constraint of energy-efficient utilization of resources is factored in, these problems become even more challenging. Thus, experts started developing solutions based on complex artificial intelligence (AI) models that, unfortunately, suffer from a performance-explainability trade-off. In this work, we propose an explainable AI (XAI) methodology for addressing this tradeoff. Our methodology can be used to generate feature importance explanations of AI models through three XAI methods: (i) Kernel SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), (ii) Counterfactual Explanations for Robustness, Transparency, Interpretability, and Fairness of Artificial Intelligence models (CERTIFAI), and (iii) Anchors. For Anchors, we formulate a new feature importance score based on the feature's presence within the rules built by the method. We then use the generated explanations to improve the understanding of the model and reduce its complexity through a feature selection process. By applying our methodology to a reinforcement learning (RL) agent designed for energy-efficient RRM, we were able to reduce its complexity by approximately 27%-62% according to various metrics, without losing performance. Additionally, we show the possibility to replace the AI-based inference process with an Anchors-based inference process with similar performance and higher interpretability for humans.  © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85159784768"

Against this background, new solutions are required. In this regard, artificial intelligence (AI) systems can support retailers, especially in personalized customer advice and customer communication. For example, smart displays recognize products selected by the customer and recommend suitable additional items, such as with Amazon 4-Star. Or employees can provide personalized advice to their customers with the help of AI-supported tablets, such as at Zara. Payment is then made without stopping at the checkout by image recognition of the purchased goods and by accessing the digital customer account, as for example at Amazon Go.

The four main components of an expert system are the knowledge base, search or inference engine, knowledge acquisition system, and user interface or communication system. The basic goal of an expert is to duplicate human experts and replace them with problem-solving. There are five main types of expert systems: rule-based systems, frame-based systems, fuzzy systems, neural systems, and neuro-fuzzy systems. A chatbot is a computer program that can mimic human conversation by using voice commands, text dialogues, or both. Chatbots can be integrated into any messaging service and are useful for providing easy and quick communication for users. Good chatbot development is dependent on the chatbot algorithm and the implementation approach employed by the chatbot developer. Today’s chatbot landscape is wide. Chatbots are not categorized as a distinct category but rather as part of a broader variety of expert systems. In this chapter, the authors summarize the expert system, technologies, and approaches used to design an AI-powered intelligent chatbot system. It will provide a space for the readers and the developers to understand the basics of expert systems and the fundamental concepts for developing a chatbot. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Archana Patel, Narayan C.

The game is challenging to play for both humans and AI-based techniques because players cannot observe each other’s moves while playing the game and one player is at a disadvantage due to the asymmetric nature of the game rules. We analyze the performance of different deep reinforcement learning algorithms to train software agents that can play the game. Existing reinforcement learning techniques for RTS games enable players to converge towards an equilibrium outcome of the game but usually do not facilitate further exploration of techniques to exploit and defeat the opponent. To address this shortcoming, we investigate techniques including self-play and strategy diversity that can be used by players to improve their performance beyond the equilibrium outcome. We observe that when players use self-play, their number of wins begins to cycle around an equilibrium value as each player quickly learns to outwit and defeat its opponent and vice-versa. Finally, we show that strategy diversity could be used as an effective means to alleviate the performance of the disadvantaged player caused by the asymmetric nature of the game. © 2023, Serious Games Society.

In addition to quantitative criteria, the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) standards include subjective evaluation which introduces inter-rater variability and potential mistakes. We explored the value of artificial intelligence (AI)-based software (ArtiQ.QC) to assess spirometry quality and compared it to traditional over-reading control. Methods A random sample of 2000 sessions (8258 curves) was selected from Chiesi COPD and asthma trials (n=1000 per disease). Acceptability using the 2005 ATS/ERS standards was determined by over-reader review and by ArtiQ.QC. Additionally, three respiratory physicians jointly reviewed a subset of curves (n=150). Results The majority of curves (n=7267, 88%) were of good quality. The AI agreed with over-readers in 91% of cases, with 97% sensitivity and 93% positive predictive value. Performance was significantly better in the asthma group. In the revised subset, n=50 curves were repeated to assess intra-rater reliability (κ=0.83, 0.86 and 0.80 for each of the three reviewers). All reviewers agreed on 63% of 100 unique tests (κ=0.5). When reviewers set the consensus (gold standard), individual agreement with it was 88%, 94% and 70%. The agreement between AI and “gold-standard” was 73%; over-reader agreement was 46%. Conclusion AI-based software can be used to measure spirometry data quality with comparable accuracy as experts. The assessment is a subjective exercise, with intra-and inter-rater variability even when the criteria are defined very precisely and objectively. By providing consistent results and immediate feedback to the sites, AI may benefit clinical trial conduct and variability reduction. © The authors 2023.","2-s2.0-85146034943"

Equally important to technical advancement is human, social, and contextual factors that impact the successful implementation and user adoption of AI-empowered CDSS (AI-CDSS). With the growing interest in human-centered design and evaluation of such tools, it is critical to synthesize the knowledge and experiences reported in prior work and shed light on future work. Methods: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a systematic review to gain an in-depth understanding of how AI-empowered CDSS was used, designed, and evaluated, and how clinician users perceived such systems. We performed literature search in five databases for articles published between the years 2011 and 2022. A total of 19874 articles were retrieved and screened, with 20 articles included for in-depth analysis. Results: The reviewed studies assessed different aspects of AI-CDSS, including effectiveness (e.g., improved patient evaluation and work efficiency), user needs (e.g., informational and technological needs), user experience (e.g., satisfaction, trust, usability, workload, and understandability), and other dimensions (e.g., the impact of AI-CDSS on workflow and patient-provider relationship). Despite the promising nature of AI-CDSS, our findings highlighted six major challenges of implementing such systems, including technical limitation, workflow misalignment, attitudinal barriers, informational barriers, usability issues, and environmental barriers. These sociotechnical challenges prevent the effective use of AI-based CDSS interventions in clinical settings. Discussion: Our study highlights the paucity of studies examining the user needs, perceptions, and experiences of AI-CDSS. Based on the findings, we discuss design implications and future research directions. Copyright © 2023 Wang, Zhang, Wang, Cao, Zhou, Zhang, Liu, Fan and Tian.","2-s2.0-85162059297"

In such applications, a large amount of data is generated about diverse aspects of our life. Although utilizing AI in real-world applications provides numerous opportunities for societies and industries, it raises concerns regarding data privacy. Data used in an AI system are cleaned, integrated, and processed throughout the AI life cycle. Each of these stages can introduce unique threats to individual's privacy and have an impact on ethical processing and protection of data. In this paper, we examine privacy risks in different phases of the AI life cycle and review the existing privacy-enhancing solutions. We introduce four different categories of privacy risk, including (i) risk of identification, (ii) risk of making an inaccurate decision, (iii) risk of non-transparency in AI systems, and (iv) risk of non-compliance with privacy regulations and best practices. We then examined the potential privacy risks in each AI life cycle phase, evaluated concerns, and reviewed privacy-enhancing technologies, requirements, and process solutions to countermeasure these risks. We also reviewed some of the existing privacy protection policies and the need for compliance with available privacy regulations in AI-based systems. The main contribution of this survey is examining privacy challenges and solutions, including technology, process, and privacy legislation in the entire AI life cycle. In each phase of the AI life cycle, open challenges have been identified.  © 2013 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85162824442"

The education industry seems to have reaped little benefits from the AI & ML industry's growth thus far. In any event, the creation of new ML & AI-based systems is mostly aimed towards areas with higher societal needs, such as medical diagnostics and individual transportation, rather than institutions of higher education. With this analysis, we want to shed some light on the mysterious state of application development in the US education industry. The report was written using a triangulation of research approaches to achieve this objective. First, we surveyed the current state-of-the-art reports from other countries and reviewed the relevant literature on AI & ML applications in the field of education. In the second phase, we analysed, to the extent possible, official documents from the United States education sector that dealt with AI and ML based on fuzzy digitalization initiatives. Third, in order to corroborate and expand upon the impressions received from the relevant literature and the document analysis, 15 guideline-based expert interviews were undertaken. Based on this data, we provide a selection of the AI & ML systems in use in universities and colleges now, analyse the benefits and drawbacks of implementing them, and speculate on their potential future evolution. While it would be a stretch to say that this paper presents a comprehensive overview of the subject, it does provide light on key areas of application and potential future research directions for AI and ML. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85159275752"

However, there are still a lack of relevant indicators to comprehensively assess its decision-making quality and clinical impact, which greatly limits the development of its clinical research and clinical application. This study aims to develop and application an assessment system that can comprehensively assess the decision-making quality and clinical impacts of physicians and CDSS. Methods: Enrolled adjuvant treatment decision stage early breast cancer cases were randomly assigned to different decision-making physician panels (each panel consisted of three different seniority physicians in different grades hospitals), each physician made an independent “Initial Decision” and then reviewed the CDSS report online and made a “Final Decision”. In addition, the CDSS and guideline expert groups independently review all cases and generate “CDSS Recommendations” and “Guideline Recommendations” respectively. Based on the design framework, a multi-level multi-indicator system including “Decision Concordance”, “Calibrated Concordance”, “ Decision Concordance with High-level Physician”, “Consensus Rate”, “Decision Stability”, “Guideline Conformity”, and “Calibrated Conformity” were constructed. Results: 531 cases containing 2124 decision points were enrolled; 27 different seniority physicians from 10 different grades hospitals have generated 6372 decision opinions before and after referring to the “CDSS Recommendations” report respectively. Overall, the calibrated decision concordance was significantly higher for CDSS and provincial-senior physicians (80.9%) than other physicians. At the same time, CDSS has a higher “ decision concordance with high-level physician” (76.3%-91.5%) than all physicians. The CDSS had significantly higher guideline conformity than all decision-making physicians and less internal variation, with an overall guideline conformity variance of 17.5% (97.5% vs. 80.0%), a standard deviation variance of 6.6% (1.3% vs. 7.9%), and a mean difference variance of 7.8% (1.5% vs. 9.3%). In addition, provincial-middle seniority physicians had the highest decision stability (54.5%). The overall consensus rate among physicians was 64.2%. Conclusions: There are significant internal variation in the standardization treatment level of different seniority physicians in different geographical regions in the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer. CDSS has a higher standardization treatment level than all physicians and has the potential to provide immediate decision support to physicians and have a positive impact on standardizing physicians’ treatment behaviors.

In the case examined, the work of consistently synchronizing interpretations of the ambiguous data and elusive rules of smart home systems prefers a stable annotation workforce with coordinated cognition and trained judgment. This technical demand has come to be met by a committed team of skilled disabled workers, who are pushed out from mainstream job market by systemic ableism, and pulled in by disability-informed expertise that reconfigures space, time, and political economy to meet non-normative bodyminds. Through this exceptional case run by a disabled people led organization, I draw attention to disabled people’s underexamined role as system-builders of information technologies as opposed to users, victims, or inspirations, and highlight the transformative potential of disability expertise © This paper is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License","2-s2.0-85153350508"

An intelligent machine can learn through experience and adapts its decisions accordingly. As such, if an intelligent machine's behaviour causes harm, the developer and the machine's owner may argue that the autonomous nature of AI systems has broken the causal link. The difficulty of determining who is liable for a harmful behaviour of an AI system is accentuated by the fact that tracing back the decision-making process of an AI system is not always possible. This paper aims to put forward a definition of a duty of care for developers and users of AI systems that could be the basis for the investigation of liability while seeking predictability of the allocation of legal liability in many cases involving AI incidents. The paper examines some guidelines on ethics for AI to discern essential elements of the duty of care in the AI environment. The paper argues that a uniform minimum standard of care should be adopted internationally through model laws or even an international convention. A uniform standard of care should be enforced by State control rather than self-regulation by the AI industry. A licensing or certification requirement for AI products should be implemented to verify that the elements of the duty of care have been satisfied to control AI production and import/export relations. Violation of the standard of care can be an objective ground to negate or allocate negligence, especially when verifying errors in the design of the relevant software or if explaining the AI system's behaviour is not possible. A clear standard of care would, this paper assumes, help promote AI development and use and would not create impediments to investment in AI production. © 2023: This is an Open Access Research distributed under the term of the Creative Commons AttributionShareAlike 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original works are properly cited.","2-s2.0-85152383503"

This has produced an increase in systematic reviews (SR) published on this topic. This article aims to evaluate the methodological quality of SRs that use AI for the diagnosis of thoracic pathology by simple chest X-ray. Material and methods: SRs evaluating the use of AI systems for the automatic reading of chest X-ray were selected. Searches were conducted (from inception to May 2022): PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Two investigators selected the reviews. From each SR, general, methodological and transparency characteristics were extracted. The PRISMA statement for diagnostic tests (PRISMA-DTA) and AMSTAR-2 were used. A narrative synthesis of the evidence was performed. Protocol registry: Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/4b6u2/. Results: After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 7 SRs were selected (mean of 36 included studies per review). All the included SRs evaluated “deep learning” systems in which chest X-ray was used for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. Only 2 (29%) SRs indicated the existence of a review protocol. None of the SRs specified the design of the included studies or provided a list of excluded studies with their justification. Six (86%) SRs mentioned the use of PRISMA or one of its extensions. The risk of bias assessment was performed in 4 (57%) SRs. One (14%) SR included studies with some validation of AI techniques. Five (71%) SRs presented results in favour of the diagnostic capacity of the intervention. All SRs were rated “critically low” following AMSTAR-2 criteria.

Like many other AI-empowered applications, robo-advisors have the potential to pose substantial risks that should be regulated and corrected by legal instruments. In this article, we attempt to discuss the regulation of robo-advisors from the perspective of the Insurance Distribution Directive and the draft AI Act. We ask two questions for each. (1) From a positive legal perspective, what obligations are imposed on insurance distributors by the legislation when they deploy robo-advisors in their business? (2) From a normative perspective, are the incumbent provisions within that legislation effective at ensuring the ethical and responsible use of robo-advisors? Our results show that neither the Insurance Distribution Directive nor the AI Act adequately address the emerging risks associated with robo-advisors. The rules implicated by them regarding the use of robo-advisors for insurance distribution are inconsistent, disproportionate, and implicit. Legislators shall further address these issues, and authorities such as EIOPA and national competent authorities must also participate by providing concrete guidelines. © 2023 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85146604191"

The chapter discusses five ethical principles (“ethical imperatives”) and their correlated values that must be respected in the development, deployment and use of AI systems. These ethical principles are: (i) respect for human autonomy; (ii) prevention of harm (non-maleficence); (iii) fairness/justice; (iv) explicability; (v) the principle of beneficence (‘do only good’), i.e., the principle of creating AI technology that is beneficial to humanity. It is explained that EU policy-makers have chosen to remain faithful to the EU’s cultural preferences and higher standard of protection against the risks posed by AI, building on the existing regulatory framework and ensuring that European values are at the heart of creating the right environment of trust for the successful development and use of AI. The overall aim of the ethics guidelines is—apart from establishing an ethical level playing field across all Member States as well as offering guidance on how to foster and secure the development of ethical AI systems—to bring a European ethical approach to the global stage, i.e. to stimulate discussion of ethical frameworks for AI “at a global level” and, therefore, to build an international consensus on AI ethics guidelines. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85164669119"

A production-ready AI system needs to be trustworthy, i.e. of high quality. But how to determine this in practice. For traditional software, ISO25000 and its predecessors have since long time been used to define and measure quality characteristics. Recently, quality models for AI systems, based on ISO25000, have been introduced. This paper applies one such quality model to a real-life case study: a deep learning platform for monitoring wildflowers. The paper presents three realistic scenarios sketching what it means to respectively use, extend and incrementally improve the deep learning platform for wildflower identification and counting. Next, it is shown how the quality model can be used as a structured dictionary to define quality requirements for data, model and software. Future work remains to extend the quality model with metrics, tools and best practices to aid AI engineering practitioners in implementing trustworthy AI systems. © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85165217536"

Public perceptions of AI are often shaped either by admiration for its benefits and possibilities, or by uncertainties, potential threats and fears about this opaque and perceived as mysterious technology. Understanding the public perception of AI, as well as its requirements and attributions, is essential for responsible research and innovation and enables aligning the development and governance of future AI systems with individual and societal needs. Methods: To contribute to this understanding, we asked 122 participants in Germany how they perceived 38 statements about artificial intelligence in different contexts (personal, economic, industrial, social, cultural, health). We assessed their personal evaluation and the perceived likelihood of these aspects becoming reality. Results: We visualized the responses in a criticality map that allows the identification of issues that require particular attention from research and policy-making. The results show that the perceived evaluation and the perceived expectations differ considerably between the domains. The aspect perceived as most critical is the fear of cybersecurity threats, which is seen as highly likely and least liked. Discussion: The diversity of users influenced the evaluation: People with lower trust rated the impact of AI as more positive but less likely. Compared to people with higher trust, they consider certain features and consequences of AI to be more desirable, but they think the impact of AI will be smaller. We conclude that AI is still a “black box” for many. Neither the opportunities nor the risks can yet be adequately assessed, which can lead to biased and irrational control beliefs in the public perception of AI. The article concludes with guidelines for promoting AI literacy to facilitate informed decision-making. Copyright © 2023 Brauner, Hick, Philipsen and Ziefle.","2-s2.0-85151962980"

This paper therefore starts with an overview of this tool, including an assessment of its strengths and limitations. The authors then consider the success by which the ALTAI tool is likely to be of utility to industry in improving understanding of the risks inherent in AI systems and best practices to mitigate such risks. It is highlighted how research and practices from fields such as Environmental Sustainability, Social Justice, and Corporate Governance (ESG) can be of benefit for addressing similar challenges in ethical AI development and deployment. Also explored is the extent to which the tool is likely to be successful in being taken up by industry, considering various factors pertaining to its likely adoption. Finally, the authors also propose recommendations applicable internationally to similar bodies to the HLEG-AI regarding the gaps needing to be addressed between high-level principles and practical support for those on the front-line developing or commercializing AI tools. In all, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of the ALTAI tool, as well as recommendations to relevant stakeholders, with the broader aim of promoting more widespread adoption of such a tool in industry.

The focus of SDGs is to provide a “blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030”. The 17 SDGs are interconnected and achieving one of the goals creates a ripple effect in the other goals. These ripple effects can be created when stakeholders use past information (data) from the societal, environmental, and economic factors, observing patterns and proffering actionable solutions. AI is a key driver that can leverage this data to create revolutionary approaches in solving global problems. For example, women have developed AI-based systems to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being. These systems that can detect breast and cervical cancer have been developed by researchers. From an African standpoint, a significant area where the role of AI will have an immense contribution is in constituting institutions. These institutions will uphold peace and justice and promote the rule of law at all national levels by building solid institutions using data. AI can leverage blockchain and distributed ledgers to support voting and boost voters’ integrity.

This matter can be greatly settled by Human-Machine Computing (HMC), which is an effective computing paradigm that couples the expertise and demonstration abilities of humans with the high-performance computing power of machines. This work studies an optimal task scheduling problem for HMC systems, where various tasks are decomposed and dispatched to humans and AI-enabled machines to provide significantly better benefits compared to either type of computing resources in isolation. However, designing such optimal task scheduling is challenging because of the stochastic hybrid features of machines, as well as various human professional abilities. Considering the Quality of Service (QoS) and the heterogeneity of human-machine computing resources, we propose CoupHM, a feasible task scheduler using gradient based optimization for HMC systems. In particular, we firstly present the underlying architecture of HMC system and details of the task-driven workload model. On that basis, we then formulate the objective optimization problem to be solved and describe the composition of the CoupHM scheduler. Finally, the performance of our solution is evaluated by the simulation experiments, and the results indicate that the proposed scheduler has preferable performance both in balancing resources and guaranteeing QoS, which can serve as guidelines for future research on HMC systems. © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85152905788"

There are substantial barriers that challenge health technology assessment (HTA) professionals to use AI-generated evidence for decision-making from large real-world databases (e.g., based on claims data). As part of the European Commission-funded HTx H2020 (Next Generation Health Technology Assessment) project, we aimed to put forward recommendations to support healthcare decision-makers in integrating AI into the HTA processes. The barriers, addressed by the paper, are particularly focusing on Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, where the implementation of HTA and access to health databases lag behind Western European countries. Methods: We constructed a survey to rank the barriers to using AI for HTA purposes, completed by respondents from CEE jurisdictions with expertise in HTA. Using the results, two members of the HTx consortium from CEE developed recommendations on the most critical barriers. Then these recommendations were discussed in a workshop by a wider group of experts, including HTA and reimbursement decision-makers from both CEE countries and Western European countries, and summarized in a consensus report. Results: Recommendations have been developed to address the top 15 barriers in areas of (1) human factor-related barriers, focusing on educating HTA doers and users, establishing collaborations and best practice sharing; (2) regulatory and policy-related barriers, proposing increasing awareness and political commitment and improving the management of sensitive information for AI use; (3) data-related barriers, suggesting enhancing standardization and collaboration with data networks, managing missing and unstructured data, using analytical and statistical approaches to address bias, using quality assessment tools and quality standards, improving reporting, and developing better conditions for the use of data; and (4) technological barriers, suggesting sustainable development of AI infrastructure. Conclusion: In the field of HTA, the great potential of AI to support evidence generation and evaluation has not yet been sufficiently explored and realized. Raising awareness of the intended and unintended consequences of AI-based methods and encouraging political commitment from policymakers is necessary to upgrade the regulatory and infrastructural environment and knowledge base required to integrate AI into HTA-based decision-making processes better.

To shed light on how AI adoption and transformation can be approached and what challenges organizations face, we analyzed eleven organizations of varying sizes and industries. Drawn on these insights, we identify four transformation types distinguished by different AI transformation stages and journeys. Furthermore, we develop a 3D-Model to guide enterprise-wide AI change and propose concrete recommendations for action on each dimension. Our findings help practitioners navigate, manage, and (re)evaluate their AI strategy for an enterprise-wide transformation. © 2023 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-85152128696"

This is especially important for safety-critical tasks. One shared characteristic of these critical tasks is their risk sensitivity, where small mistakes can cause big consequences and even endanger life. There are several factors that could be guidelines for the successful deployment of AI systems in sensitive tasks: (i) failure detection and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection; (ii) overfitting identification; (iii) uncertainty quantification for predictions; (iv) robustness to data perturbations. These factors are also challenges of current AI systems, which are major blocks for building safe and reliable AI. Specifically, the current AI algorithms are unable to identify common causes for failure detection. Furthermore, additional techniques are required to quantify the quality of predictions. All these contribute to inaccurate uncertainty quantification, which lowers trust in predictions. Hence obtaining accurate model uncertainty quantification and its further improvement are challenging. To address these issues, many techniques have been proposed, such as regularization methods and learning strategies. As vision and language are the most typical data type and have many open source benchmark datasets, this thesis will focus on vision-language data processing for tasks like classification, image captioning, and vision question answering. In this thesis, we aim to build a safeguard by further developing current techniques to ensure the accurate model uncertainty for safety-critical tasks. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85151049574"

However, implementing AI in administrative procedures requires a comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities and limitations of different systems, including considerations of transparency and data availability. Data are a crucial factor in the operation of AI systems and the validity of their predictions. It is essential to ensure that the data used to train AI algorithms are extensive, representative, and free of bias. Transparency is also an important aspect establishing trust and reliability in AI systems, particularly regarding the potential for transparent representation in rule-based and machine-learning AI systems.

Diabetes and related complications represent a significant source of health disparities. Vision loss is a complication of diabetes, and there is extensive evidence supporting annual eye exams for prevention. Prior to the use of autonomous AI, store-and-forward imaging approaches using remote reading centers (asynchronous telemedicine) attempted to increase diabetes related eye exams with limited success. In 2018, after rigorous clinical validation, the first fully autonomous AI system [LumineticsCore™ (formerly IDx-DR), Digital Diagnostics Inc., Coralville, IA, United States] received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) De Novo authorization. The system diagnoses diabetic retinopathy (including macular edema) without specialist physician overread at the point-of-care. In addition to regulatory clearance, reimbursement, and quality measure updates, successful adoption requires local optimization of the clinical workflow. The general challenges of frontline care clinical workflow have been well documented in the literature. Because healthcare AI is so new, there remains a gap in the literature about challenges and opportunities to embed diagnostic AI into the clinical workflow. The goal of this review is to identify common workflow themes leading to successful adoption, measured as attainment number of exams per month using the autonomous AI system against targets set for each health center. We characterized the workflow in four different US health centers over a 12-month period. Health centers were geographically dispersed across the Midwest, Southwest, Northeast, and West Coast and varied distinctly in terms of size, staffing, resources, financing and demographics of patient populations. After 1 year, the aggregated number of diabetes-related exams per month increased from 89 after the first month of initial deployment to 174 across all sites. Across the diverse practice types, three primary determinants underscored sustainable adoption: (1) Inclusion of Executive and Clinical Champions; (2) Underlining Health Center Resources; and (3) Clinical workflows that contemplate patient identification (pre-visit), LumineticsCore Exam Capture and Provider Consult (patient visit), and Timely Referral Triage (post-visit). In addition to regulatory clearance, reimbursement and quality measures, our review shows that addressing the core determinants for workflow optimization is an essential part of large-scale adoption of innovation. These best practices can be generalizable to other autonomous AI systems in front-line care settings, thereby increasing patient access, improving quality of care, and addressing health disparities. 2023 Goldstein, Weitzman, Lemerond and Jones.","2-s2.0-85161033814"

However, the success of AI components in educational environments is by no means guaranteed and depends on several conditions in their respective learning settings. In this article, we analyze requirements that are often addressed prior to introducing AI features. We address organizational, methodological, didactical, content-related, and technical challenges. The research question of this work is how AI features can best be incorporated into modern educational system landscapes to create sustainable system architectures that are accepted and perceived as added value by users. Thereby, the article discusses two approaches to software architecture: Best-of-Suite (for monolithic architectures) and Best-of-Breed (for service-oriented architectures). Monolithic systems offer a wide range of functions, can be offered by a single provider but can become difficult to manage and create dependencies. Specialized and service-oriented systems, in turn, consist of modular functions handled by specialized services, are more flexible and scalable, and can be integrated with a wide range of tools and services, but require more effort to set up and manage. We explain why the Best-of-Breed strategy is a sensible approach to the use of AI components, how this can be implemented sustainably with the help of a middleware component, and we report on the user experiences from a field test. While in this work we evaluate the implemented system with a cybersecurity training as an on-the-job course, the middleware has been successfully used in other educational contexts, as well. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85164247368"

AI-based healthcare technologies can support diagnosis processes and make healthcare more accessible globally. In this context, we conducted a design science research project intending to introduce design principles for user interfaces (UIs) of explainable AI-based (XAI) medical decision support systems (XAI-based MDSS). We used an archaeological approach to analyze the UI of an existing web-based system in the context of skin lesion classification called DIAnA (Dermatological Images – Analysis and Archiving). One of DIAnA’s unique characteristics is that it should be usable for the stakeholder groups of physicians and patients. We conducted the in-situ analysis with these stakeholders using the think-aloud method and semi-structured interviews. We anchored our interview guide in concepts of the Theory of Interactive Media Effects (TIME), which formulates UI features as causes and user psychology as effects. Based on the results, we derived 20 design requirements and developed nine design principles grounded in TIME for this class of XAI-based MDSS, either associated with the needs of physicians, patients, or both. Regarding evaluation, we first conducted semi-structured interviews with software developers to assess the reusability of our design principles. Afterward, we conducted a survey with user experience/interface designers. The evaluation uncovered that 77% of the participants would adopt the design principles, and 82% would recommend them to colleagues for a suitable project. The findings prove the reusability of the design principles and highlight a positive perception by potential implementers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85161153089"

With the internet of things, energy, and the cyber-physical systems governed by it coming to an end, conventional education faces an immense challenge. That will associate this tension with internet usage and reward students and teachers alike. It can be claimed that future education is entirely built on the internet of things, energy, and the cyber-physical systems ruled by it. As these systems end, traditional education confronts a massive challenge. This moves increases students' screening time, which influences their mental health. Theoretical Framework: The paper speculates on the near future of research in Artificial Intelligence and Education (AIED), on the basis of three uses of models of educational processes with also evaluating literature available. Design/Methodology/Approach: The classification algorithms SVM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest benefit from 5-fold Cross-Validation with 206 students from Delhi NCR and outside. Researcher is finding for how are the ages distributed? How many students got mental health care? So, what did they do? Their ages? How many meals did they eat? After the COVID-19 virus spread in Delhi, India, the study looked at factors that led to an increased mental health burden for undergraduate students in the city. The dataset is constructed by combining data from several domains such as age, time, medium meals etc. Thus, researcher pre-processed the data and classified it into four categories based on their location within the Delhi NCR and outside the NCR. The suggested model is evaluated using a K field fold cross-validation test. Findings: The findings have shown that practical implications of technology will positively impact education in the future, but it may also have severe implications. Teachers and students should grasp this chance to encourage greatness and break down the hurdles that keep many children and schools from reaching it. As a result, all countries must develop a more technologically advanced education system in the future. Research, Practical and social implications: The study in advances in technology will have major distractions in the workforce as automation might replace more than fifty percent of jobs. It is crucial to teach students skills to thrive in digital workplace, engage positively with technology to explore its full potential. The contribution of this study about AI systems are technically feasible for instructor-learner interaction. It is important to foster AI literacy in students to break the barrier of misconceptions and make way for imagination, innovation with new perspectives in society.

This study focuses on asphalt road surfaces, which are typically renovated every 10 years depending on the amount of traffic and roadbed properties. Existing MCI (Maintenance Control Index) measurement systems come at a high cost to local governments and are not efficient in allowing engineers to detect cracks and deficiencies. New road pavement assessment systems, as developed by our research group, are needed to ensure sustainable road maintenance and management. Pavement surface evaluation system development involves the use of a video camera and a 3D motion sensor, which can be used for simple and low-cost inspections. However, 3D motion sensors can only capture acceleration. Because of this, they can only be used to illustrate the roughness of the road surface, not to detect cracks. In this study, to utilize road surface video recorded while driving, we have developed a method of automatic extraction of deformations by an AI object detection function. This function specifically serves to extract cracks, joints, manholes, and repair marks detections from the surface video. However, in using this function, the accuracy for detecting cracks was less than 40% (Shiga et al. 2020). In this study, we aim to apply this method to detect deformations and suggest annotation rules for improving the accuracy of crack detection, as well as overall accuracy. To discuss the accuracy of detecting cracks and other deformities, cracks are divided into different types and deep learning is performed. In addition, we enlarged images of the cracks. The results of this study show that the AI object detection function for cracks is made more accurate by utilizing annotation rules and making a learning data rule set divided by the crack type classification. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","2-s2.0-85151151426"

Knowing the best techniques for cyber security is essential for defending against these threats. Despite their ability to be useful, conventional learning techniques like reading articles or attending seminars lack interest. Because of this, employing serious games for education is growing in popularity. Serious games give players an involved learning experience while educating them on a subject, like cyber security. In order to give players a useful understanding to defend themselves, this study investigates the best approaches for embedding cyber security education into serious games. Learning about cyber security is made enjoyable and more relevant by using a game-based methodology. In order to evaluate how game design aspects might be utilized to effectively instruct players on cyber security, the paper examines a variety of game design elements, including game mechanics, narrative, and feedback mechanisms. Additionally, it goes into how different players, such as novice and experienced players, might be catered to in serious games.

Areas covered: AI systems may qualify as standalone medical device software (MDSW) or be embedded within a medical device. Within the European Union (EU) AI software must undergo a conformity assessment procedure to be approved as a medical device. The draft EU Regulation on AI proposes rules that will apply across industry sectors, while for devices the Medical Device Regulation also applies. In the CORE-MD project (Coordinating Research and Evidence for Medical Devices), we have surveyed definitions and summarize initiatives made by professional consensus groups, regulators, and standardization bodies. Expert opinion: The level of clinical evidence required should be determined according to each application and to legal and methodological factors that contribute to risk, including accountability, transparency, and interpretability. EU guidance for MDSW based on international recommendations does not yet describe the clinical evidence needed for medical AI software. Regulators, notified bodies, manufacturers, clinicians and patients would all benefit from common standards for the clinical evaluation of high-risk AI applications and transparency of their evidence and performance. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-85158971289"

This issue in particular plagues the online chess scene, where the strongest algorithms have long surpassed the world’s best players [4] – any cheater can beat the best human players through computer assistance. Moreover, recent developments in AI-based chess engines have opened the door to even more human-like engines [33], which are increasingly able to mimic legitimate human players. Unfortunately, because major chess websites do not discuss their cheat detection mechanisms publicly, there is limited scientific literature on how to tackle the pervasive problem of cheating in online chess. Certainly, there is no way to validate whether these mechanisms actually work. We take a first step towards formalizing a proper cheat detection framework for online chess by leveraging a large-scale statistical examination of human and computer decision-making tendencies over millions of chess games played online. Although cheaters are not engines (computer players) but centaurs (computer-assisted human players), the insights into computer play serve as a useful guideline for finding the strongest indicators of cheating. We then demonstrate how these findings may distinguish legitimate human players from cheaters in an automated, rules-based manner. Additionally, we argue that the status quo of hiding cheat detection mechanisms from the public eye is dangerous to the integrity of the game, and that cheat detection is foremost a service to society instead of a competitive advantage for chess websites to attract more users. Consistent with Kerckhoffs’ paradigm [24], we believe that the benefits of an open discussion on cheat detection far outweigh the potential drawbacks of cheaters learning about these methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85163378777"

Permeating many aspects of our lives and influencing our choices, development in this field continues to advance and increasingly impacts us as individuals and our society. The risks and unintended effects such as bias from input data or algorithm design have recently stirred discourse about how to inform and teach AI in K-12 education. As AI is a new topic not only for pupils in K-12 but also for teachers, new skill sets are required that enable critical engagement with AI. AI literacy is trying to close the gap between research and practical knowledge transfer of AI-related skills. Teachers' AI-related technological, pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) are important factors for AI literacy. However, as teachers' perspectives, beliefs and views impact both the interpretation and operationalisation of curriculum. this study explores teachers' and teacher educators' understanding and preconceptions of AI to inform teacher education and professional development. To gain a comprehensive understanding of teachers’ conceptualisations regarding AI an anonymous questionnaire together with focus group discussions were employed. The qualitative content analysis underpinned by the theoretical framework Intelligent TPACK reveals that teachers' AI-related content knowledge is generally gained through incidental learning and often results in pre- and misconceptions of AI. Our analysis also revealed several potential challenges for teachers in achieving core constructs of Intelligent TPACK, examples of such challenges are vague and unclear guidelines in both policy and curriculum, a lack of understanding of AI and its limitations, as well as emotional responses related to participants' preconceptions. These insights are important to consider in designing teacher education and professional development related to AI literacy. © 2023, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85163769587"

This document served as the first guidance for developing agencies and was reviewed to understand the requirements for these new systems. As engineers, the desire is to view the Ethical Principles as evaluation criteria and identify the means by which a system can be qualified against the language laid out by the Defense Innovation Board.One of the first parallels that was identified with this document was the concept of an assurance case. The Ethical Principles do not explicitly lay out any requirements but are more so suggestions or guidelines so the question was how to demonstrate adherence or fulfillment. To this extent the Materiel Release process [2], the process the U.S. Army follows to deploy and field a system, was reviewed as a means to demonstrate fulfillment through the requirements and documentation dictated by that process.This paper demonstrates how the processes and procedures followed by the U.S. Army, in pursuit of mitigating risks for fielding, also in turn fulfill the intent of the Ethical Principles. Upon further review of the principles, it can be observed as design best practices to ensure the development of trusted and assured products. The Materiel Release process is proposed as an assurance case for the adherence to the Ethical Principles of AI. The MR process and associated feeder processes are here compared to the language embodied in the Ethical Principles to the extent that the application of the same rigorous processes done for traditional systems may be applied to AI enabled systems-and in some cases adapted-to ensure justified confidence in the delivered product. Systems that have gone through a Materiel Release review can thus also be said to have demonstrated, as a byproduct, adherence to the Ethical Principles of AI. © 2023 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85153266309"

Since static obstacles like walls, rocks, or shipwrecks can lie on the sea bottom, bottom tracking needs to be extended with obstacle avoidance. As AUVs face a wide range of uncertainties, implementing these essential operations is still challenging. A simple rule-based control method has been proposed in [7] to realize obstacle avoidance.

We propose the use of class activation maps (CAMs) and our modified malignancy-specific heat maps that locate important deep representations of thyroid nodules for class predictions. Methods: We applied adversarial noise perturbations to the segmented concentric “hot” nodular regions of equal sizes to differentiate regional importance for the malignancy diagnostic performances of an accurate ultrasound-based artificial intelligence computer-aided diagnosis (AI-CADx) system using 2,602 retrospectively collected thyroid nodules with known histopathological diagnosis. Results: The AI system demonstrated high diagnostic performance with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.9302 and good nodule identification capability with a median dice coefficient >0.9 when compared to radiologists’ segmentations. Experiments confirmed that the CAM-based heat maps reflect the differentiable importance of different nodular regions for an AI-CADx system to make its predictions. No less importantly, the hot regions in malignancy heat maps of ultrasound images in comparison with the inactivated regions of the same 100 malignant nodules randomly selected from the dataset had higher summed frequency-weighted feature scores of 6.04 versus 4.96 rated by radiologists with more than 15 years of ultrasound examination experience according to widely used ultrasound-based risk stratification American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) in terms of nodule composition, echogenicity, and echogenic foci, excluding shape and margin attributes, which could only be evaluated on the whole rather than on the sub-nodular component levels. In addition, we show examples demonstrating good spatial correspondence of highlighted regions of malignancy heat map to malignant tumor cell-rich regions in hematoxylin and eosin-stained histopathological images. Conclusion: Our proposed CAM-based ultrasonographic malignancy heat map provides quantitative visualization of malignancy heterogeneity within a tumor, and it is of clinical interest to investigate in the future its usefulness to improve fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) sampling reliability by targeting potentially more suspicious sub-nodular regions.

We also discuss fundamental threat scenarios in the context of our information society, as well as the limits of AI technology compared with human intelligence. The article highlights that the development of AI technology, as well as related policies and regulations, must be organized to ensure its socially acceptable use and rule out any improper use. Furthermore, the article provides a philosophical discussion on the limits of AI and the diversity of life, and shows that we bear the ultimate responsibility for what machines do. This paper concludes by arguing that even the most sophisticated machine will probably never be able to match humans in terms of their multi-dimensionality of cognition, emotion, and physicality and in their sensual perception of the world. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85152469112"

This is especially true for assembly tasks, requiring a high level of perception, skill, and adaptability. With the rise of smart manufacturing, intelligent manufacturing, and other aspects related to Industry 4.0, the hurdles for automation of the aforementioned tasks are getting reduced. Especially Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to enable smart and flexible automation since it is possible to deduct decisions from unknown multidimensional correlations in sensor data, which is critical for the assembly of highly customized products. In this research paper, three different conventional and AI-based glue detection models are proposed with the target to automate a gluing process in a manual assembly of highly customized products in a batch size one production scenario. A conventional, one-dimensional rule-based model, and two hybrid models using a support vector machine image classifier (SVM) and either Tamura features or convolutional neural network (CNN) feature extraction are presented and compared. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of AI-based algorithms, as the CNN and SVM hybrid model outperforms the other two approaches achieving a prediction accuracy of &gt;99% at the fastest classification speed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85152124345"

However, for a molecule to be considered a viable drug candidate, it must exhibit certain desirable properties such as low toxicity, high druggability, and synthesizability. To address this, we propose an approach that incorporates prior knowledge about these properties during the model training process. In this study, we utilized the PubChem database, which contains 100 million molecules, to filter drug-like molecules based on the quantity of drug-likeliness (QED) score and the Pfizer rule. We then used this filtered dataset of drug-like molecules to train both molecular representation (ChemBERTa) and molecular generation models (MolGPT). To assess the performance of the molecular representation model, we fine-tuned the results on the MoleculeNet benchmark datasets. Meanwhile, we evaluated the performance of the molecular generation model based on the generated samples comprising 10,000 molecules. Despite the limited diversity of the pre-training dataset, the models for molecular representation were able to retain at least 90% of their original performance on benchmark datasets, with an additional improvement of 6% in predicting clinical toxicology. In the domain of molecular generation, the model pre-trained on drug-like molecules exhibited a high rate of desirable molecule properties in the unconditionally generated outputs. Additionally, the diversity of generated structures demonstrated notable performance compared to the conditional generation approach. Moreover, the drug-like molecule pre-training strategy is not limited to a specific model or training method, making it a flexible approach that can be easily modified based on the research interests and criteria of interest.  © 2013 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85162644701"

Different railway stakeholders are already developing their research activities for the future driverless autonomous driving based on computer vision (CV) and artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced perception technologies (e.g., obstacle detection). Unfortunately, the AI models are opaque in nature, and there are no certification accepted rules for CV&AI-enhanced functionality certification. Capturing and labeling camera image in real environment is expensive in terms of time and resources and it does not guarantee enough variation in edge visibility conditions, which makes the resulting database less valuable for the validation and verification (V&V) processes. To meet the increasing needs of trusted CV&AI-based solutions, numerous V&V approaches have been proposed in other sectors such as automotive, most of them based on virtual simulators. Unfortunately, there is currently no virtual perception simulator for railway scenario. This work aims to create a semi-automatic system based on virtual scenarios measuring the CV&AI-enhanced system performance facing different visibility conditions. It will be based on the global accuracy metrics and detected potential safety and operation rules' violations.

It took the COVID-19 pandemic for AI and its subsets to take the center stage in medicine and health care. AI is a broad discipline and encompasses machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and other techniques. Advancements in AI enabled, facilitated, and accelerated the expansion of telehealth. Telehealth describes the wide array of digital information and communication technologies and systems that allow the delivery of health and health-related services. There are three distinct subtypes of telehealth: synchronous, asynchronous, and remote (tele) monitoring. The overarching goal of telehealth is to break down barriers in delivery of high value care by overcoming challenges resulting from time or location constraints. The end goal is not to replace in-person care, rather to commoditize and democratize high quality, high value care. On the other hand, there remain significant limitations and pitfalls, particularly regulatory and technological. Examples include best practice guidelines on the adaptation of standards regulating data exchange, expansion of reimbursement and importantly ethical challenges. The latter include critical issues such as data privacy, security, and governance, AI-introduced bias, the black box nature of some AI/ML algorithms and the impact of AI technologies/algorithms on health disparities and inequities. Disparities in access to and use of tele-health were already known but highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognition of this hurdle led to the emerging and rapidly growing field of digital determinants of health, which comprise factors like digital literacy, access to AI/technology, and community infrastructure like access to WiFi/broadband internet. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Rule- and AI-based algorithms that interpret high-quality point cloud scans have been developed, thus making it possible to evaluate a process crane’s specific handling operations reliably. Existing CAD models of the crane assemblies are automatically fitted into the point cloud for the central process of fused data analysis. The workflow starts with the localization of the loading beam’s cables to estimate its initial orientation and position. The CAD models of the lifting beam and all other lifting system components are successively fitted into the point cloud exactly with the aid of local registration. Swivel joint design constraints are factored into the assessment. The lifting operation is displayed in a VR model automatically receiving all component orientations and positions and the load every second. The crane operator can view the current situation from defined perspectives and additionally receives information on crane component position, spacing and the load, which is needed to control the crane. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85149668650"

To this end, AI is used in varying techniques to automate sophisticated functions in UX and thereby changing what UX is apprehended by the users. This is achieved through the development of intelligent interactive systems such as virtual assistants, recommender systems, and intelligent tutoring systems. The changes are well received, as technological achievements but create new challenges of trust, explainability and usability to humans, which in turn need to be amended by further advancements of AI in reciprocity. AI can be utilised to enhance the UX of a system while the quality of the UX can influence the effectiveness of AI. The state of the art in AI for UX is constantly evolving, with a growing focus on designing transparent, explainable, and fair AI systems that prioritise user control and autonomy, protect user data privacy and security, and promote diversity and inclusivity in the design process. Staying up to date with the latest advancements and best practices in this field is crucial.

Risks, regulation, responsibility, and ethics shape the demand of clinical users to understand and rely on the outputs made by artificial intelligence. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) offers methods to render a model’s behavior understandable from different perspectives. Extant XAI, however, is mainly data-driven and designed to meet developers’ demands to correct models rather than clinical users’ expectations to reflect clinically relevant information. To this end, informed machine learning (IML) utilizes prior knowledge jointly with data to generate predictions, a promising paradigm to enrich XAI with medical knowledge. To explore how IML can be used to generate explanations that are congruent to clinical users’ demands and useful to medical decision-making, we conduct Action Design Research (ADR) in collaboration with a team of radiologists. We propose an IML-based XAI system for clinically relevant explanations of diagnostic imaging predictions. With the help of ADR, we reduce the gap between implementation and user evaluation and demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in a real-world application with clinicians. While we develop design principles of using IML for user-centric XAI in diagnostic imaging, the study demonstrates that an IML-based design adequately reflects clinicians’ conceptions.

However, previous reviews have found a limited amount of research on such systems’ accuracy. This systematic review of the literature aimed to identify the main challenges in determining the accuracy of patient-operated digital AI-based triage systems. Methods A systematic review was designed and conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines in October 2021 using PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. Articles were included if they assessed the accuracy of a patient-operated digital triage system that had an AI-component and could triage a general primary care population. Limitations and other pertinent data were extracted, synthesized and analysed. Risk of bias was not analysed as this review studied the included articles’ limitations (rather than results). Results were synthesized qualitatively using a thematic analysis. Results The search generated 76 articles and following exclusion 8 articles (6 primary articles and 2 reviews) were included in the analysis. Articles’ limitations were synthesized into three groups: epistemological, ontological and methodological limitations. Limitations varied with regards to intractability and the level to which they can be addressed through methodological choices. Certain methodological limitations related to testing triage systems using vignettes can be addressed through methodological adjustments, whereas epistemological and ontological limitations require that readers of such studies appraise the studies with limitations in mind. Discussion The reviewed literature highlights recurring limitations and challenges in studying the accuracy of patient-operated digital triage systems with AI components. Some of these challenges can be addressed through methodology whereas others are intrinsic to the area of inquiry and involve unavoidable trade-offs.

A healthy lifestyle can help to avoid chronic diseases and long-term illnesses. A monitoring and automatic personalized lifestyle recommendation system (i.e., automatic electronic coach or eCoach) with considering clinical and ethical guidelines, individual health status, condition, and preferences may successfully help participants to follow recommendations to maintain a healthy lifestyle. As a prerequisite for the prototype design of such a helpful eCoach system, it is essential to involve the end-users and subject-matter experts throughout the iterative design process. Methods: We used an iterative user-centered design (UCD) approach to understend context of use and to collect qualitative data to develop a roadmap for self-management with eCoaching. We involved researchers, non-technical and technical, health professionals, subject-matter experts, and potential end-users in design process. We designed and developed the eCoach prototype in two stages, adopting different phases of the iterative design process. In design workshop 1, we focused on identifying end-users, understanding the user’s context, specifying user requirements, designing and developing an initial low-fidelity eCoach prototype. In design workshop 2, we focused on maturing the low-fidelity solution design and development for the visualization of continuous and discrete data, artificial intelligence (AI)-based interval forecasting, personalized recommendations, and activity goals. Results: The iterative design process helped to develop a working prototype of eCoach system that meets end-user’s requirements and expectations towards an effective recommendation visualization, considering diversity in culture, quality of life, and human values. The design provides an early version of the solution, consisting of wearable technology, a mobile app following the “Google Material Design” guidelines, and web content for self-monitoring, goal setting, and lifestyle recommendations in an engaging manner between the eCoach app and end-users. Conclusions: The adopted iterative design process brings in a design focus on the user and their needs at each phase. Throughout the design process, users have been involved at the heart of the design to create a working research prototype to improve the fit between technology, end-user, and researchers. Furthermore, we performed a technological readiness study of ProHealth eCoach against standard levels set by European Union (EU). © 2022, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85137155875"

Although AI models have achieved human-like performance, their use is still limited because they are seen as a black box. This lack of trust remains the main reason for their low use in practice, especially in healthcare. Hence, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has been introduced as a technique that can provide confidence in the model's prediction by explaining how the prediction is derived, thereby encouraging the use of AI systems in healthcare. The primary goal of this review is to provide areas of healthcare that require more attention from the XAI research community. Methods: Multiple journal databases were thoroughly searched using PRISMA guidelines 2020. Studies that do not appear in Q1 journals, which are highly credible, were excluded. Results: In this review, we surveyed 99 Q1 articles covering the following XAI techniques: SHAP, LIME, GradCAM, LRP, Fuzzy classifier, EBM, CBR, rule-based systems, and others. Conclusion: We discovered that detecting abnormalities in 1D biosignals and identifying key text in clinical notes are areas that require more attention from the XAI research community.

Artificial intelligence (AI) may improve dedicated algorithms. Objectives: To assess performance of different AI-based approaches to distinguish asthmatics from COPD patients in medico-administrative databases where the clinical diagnosis is absent. An “Asthma COPD Overlap” category was defined to further test whether AI can detect complexity. Methods: This study included 178,962 patients treated by two “R03” treatment prescriptions at least from January 2016 to December 2018 and managed by either a general practitioner and/or a pulmonologist participating in a permanent longitudinal observatory of prescription in ambulatory medicine (LPD). Clinical diagnoses are available in this database and were used as gold standards to develop diagnostic rules. Three types of AI approaches were explored using data restricted to demographics and treatment dispensations: multinomial regression, gradient boosting and recurrent neural networks (RNN). The best performing model (based on metric properties) was then applied to estimate the size of asthma and COPD populations based on a database (LRx) of treatment dispensations between July, 2018 and June, 2019. Results: The best models were obtained with the boosting approach and RNN, with an overall accuracy of 68%. Performance metrics were better for asthma than COPD. Based on LRx data, the extrapolated numbers of patients treated for asthma and COPD in France were 3.7 and 1.2 million, respectively. Asthma patients were younger than COPD patients (mean, 49.9 vs. 72.1 years); COPD occurred mostly in men (68%) compared to asthma (33%). Conclusion: AI can provide models with acceptable accuracy to distinguish between asthma, ACO and COPD in medico-administrative databases where the clinical diagnosis is absent. Deep learning and machine learning (RNN) had similar performances in this regard. © 2022, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85138217730"

Commercial Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an important topic for research. Artificial intelligence is growing quickly more sensitive and popular in the digital marketing field due to the capacity of advertisers to employ it efficiently. In order to provide the capability of the highest level of originality and efficiency in digital marketing ground, artificial intelligence techniques are more fruitful for customers, marketers and, retailers. This paper depicts the impact of artificial intelligence techniques on advertising on a diminutive and average scale in the digital marketing field. Ad targeting, predictive analysis, voice search are different artificial intelligence techniques for digital marketing purposes throughout the consumer life cycle. The topic of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital marketing itself can be outsized enough to verifyeliminating the area of research into precise application and application frameworks.However, our objective in this paper is to provide a comparative analysis of the digital marketing field using artificial intelligence techniques and to propose some specific guidelines based on different parameters, tools, and frameworks.Through this paper, we have observed thelast five years (2016-2021) research trends which reflect that out of different parameters, customer relationship and promotional activity are the most widely used parameter in the digital marketing field. Another significant point is, most of the research identifies that artificial intelligence is a compulsory technique used in the modern digital marketing field. Some data collection and data analysis tools are also being used in this field using artificial intelligence techniques. Our research methods try to get a complete view on artificial intelligence (AI) Marketing were multifaceted but were very focused on secondary research sources. Finally in this paper, we propose some recommendationsthat will offer better Artificial Intelligence (AI) implementation in the digital marketing field. © 2022 American Institute of Physics Inc..

This paper aims to advance the research exploring the gap between practice and principles in AI ethics by identifying how companies are applying those guidelines and principles in practice. Through a qualitative methodology based on 22 semi-structured interviews and two focus groups, the goal of the current study is to understand how companies approach ethical issues related to AI systems. A structured analysis of the transcripts brought out many actual practices and findings, which are presented around the following main research topics: ethics and principles, privacy, explainability, and fairness. The interviewees also raised issues of accountability and governance. Finally, some recommendations are suggested such as developing specific sector regulations, fostering a data-driven organisational culture, considering the algorithm’s complete life cycle, developing and using a specific code of ethics, and providing specific training on ethical issues. Despite some obvious limitations, such as the type and number of companies interviewed, this work identifies real examples and direct priorities to advance the research exploring the gap between practice and principles in AI ethics, with a specific focus on Spanish companies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85113948828"

Among different attacks on AD perception, object-hiding adversarial attack is one of the most critical ones due to the direct impact on safety-critical driving decisions such as collision avoidance. However, all of the prior works on physical object-hiding adversarial attacks only study the security of the AI component alone rather than with the entire AD system pipeline with closed-loop control. This thus inevitably raises a critical research question: can these prior works actually achieve system-level effects (e.g., vehicle collisions, traffic rule violation) under real-world AD settings with closed-loop control? To answer this critical question, in this work we take the necessary first step by performing the first measurement study on whether and how effective the existing designs can lead to system-level effects. Our early results find that RP2 and FTE, as two representative examples of prior works, cannot achieve any system-level effect in a representative closed-loop AD setup in common STOP sign-controlled road speeds. In the future, we plan to 1) perform a more comprehensive measurement study using both simulated environments and a real vehicle-sized AD R&D chassis; and 2) analyze the measurement study results and explore new attack designs that can better achieve the system-level effect in AD systems. © 2022 Owner/Author.","2-s2.0-85143049135"

This work intends to perceive how those public institutions can evaluate and select their candidates efficiently during the different phases of the recruitment process. To achieve this purpose, artificial intelligence (AI) was studied. This paper aims to focus on analysing the AI technologies most used and appropriate to the PF as a complementary recruitment strategy of the National Criminal Investigation police agency of Portugal – Polícia Judiciária. Design/methodology/approach: Using design science research as a methodological approach, the authors suggest a theoretical framework in pair with the segmentation of the candidates and comprehend the most important facts facing public institutions regarding the usage of AI technologies to make decisions about evaluating and selecting candidates. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses methodology guidelines, a systematic literature review and meta-analyses method was adopted to identify how the usage and exploitation of transparent AI positively impact the recruitment process of a public institution, resulting in an analysis of 34 papers between 2017 and 2021. Findings: Results suggest that the conceptual pairing of evaluation and selection problems of candidates who apply to PC with applicable AI technology such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, artificial neural network and convolutional neural network algorithms can support the recruitment process and could help reduce the workload in the entire process while maintaining the standard of responsibility. The combination of AI and human decision-making is a fair, objective and unbiased process emphasising a decision-making process free of nepotism and favouritism when carefully developed. Innovative and modern as a category, group the statements that emphasise the innovative and contemporary nature of the process. Research limitations/implications: There are two main limitations in this study that should be considered. Firstly, the difficulty regarding the timetable, privacy and legal issues associated with public institutions. Secondly, a small group of experts served as the validation group for the new framework. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted to alleviate this constraint. They provide additional insights into an interviewee’s opinions and beliefs. Social implications: Ensure that the system is fair, transparent and facilitates their application process. Originality/value: The main contribution is the AI-based theoretical framework, applicable within the analysis of literature papers, focusing on the problem of how the institutions can gain insights about their candidates while profiling them, how to obtain more accurate information from the interview phase and how to reach a more rigorous assessment of their emotional intelligence providing a better alignment of moral values.

With the criticality of decisions they support and the potential consequences of following their recommendations, it also became critical to provide users with explanations to interpret machine learning models in general, and black-box models in particular. However, despite the agreement on explainability as a necessity, there is little evidence on how recent advances in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence literature (XAI) can be applied in collaborative decision-making tasks, i.e., human decision-maker and an AI system working together, to contribute to the process of trust calibration effectively. This research conducts an empirical study to evaluate four XAI classes for their impact on trust calibration. We take clinical decision support systems as a case study and adopt a within-subject design followed by semi-structured interviews. We gave participants clinical scenarios and XAI interfaces as a basis for decision-making and rating tasks. Our study involved 41 medical practitioners who use clinical decision support systems frequently. We found that users perceive the contribution of explanations to trust calibration differently according to the XAI class and to whether XAI interface design fits their job constraints and scope.

AI is still new and unknown to many healthcare professionals in emergency care, leading to unfamiliarity with its capabilities. Method: Various criteria were used to establish the suitability of the articles to answer the research question. This study was based on 34 selected peer-reviewed papers on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Emergency Department (ED), published in the last five years. Drawing on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, all articles were scanned, read full-text, and analyzed afterward. Results: The majority of the AI applications consisted of AI-based tools to aid with clinical decisions and to relieve overcrowded EDs of their burden. AI support was mostly offered during triage, the moment that sets the patient trajectory. There is ample evidence that AI-based applications could improve the clinical decision-making process. Conclusion: The use of AI in EDs is still in its nascent stages. Many studies focus on the question of whether AI has clinical utility, such as decision support, improving resource allocation, reducing diagnostic errors, and promoting proactivity. Some studies suggest that AI-based tools essentially have the ability to outperform human skills. However, it is evident from the literature that current technology does not have the aims or power to do so. Nevertheless, AI-based tools can impact clinician work design in the ED by providing support with clinical decisions, which could ultimately help alleviate a portion of the increasing clinical burden. © 2022, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85130261310"

While best practices are well-established for training and validating new models, there has been limited work developing best practices for prospective validation and model maintenance. In this paper, we highlight the need for updating clinical prediction models and discuss open questions regarding this critical aspect of the AI modeling lifecycle in three focus areas: model maintenance policies, performance monitoring perspectives, and model updating strategies. With the increasing adoption of AI-enabled tools, the need for such best practices must be addressed and incorporated into new and existing implementations. This commentary aims to encourage conversation and motivate additional research across clinical and data science stakeholders. 2022 Davis, Walsh and Matheny.","2-s2.0-85138156015"

However, manual quantitation of PD-L1 positivity can be difficult and leads to substantial inter-observer variability. Although the development of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms may mitigate some of the challenges associated with manual assessment and improve the accuracy of PD-L1 expression scoring, use of AI-based approaches to oncology biomarker scoring and drug development has been sparse, primarily due to the lack of large-scale clinical validation studies across multiple cohorts and tumor types. We developed AI-powered algorithms to evaluate PD-L1 expression on tumor cells by IHC and compared it with manual IHC scoring in urothelial carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (prospectively determined during the phase II and III CheckMate clinical trials). 1,746 slides were retrospectively analyzed, the largest investigation of digital pathology algorithms on clinical trial datasets performed to date. AI-powered quantification of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells identified more PD-L1–positive samples compared with manual scoring at cutoffs of ≥1% and ≥5% in most tumor types. Additionally, similar improvements in response and survival were observed in patients identified as PD-L1–positive compared with PD-L1–negative using both AI-powered and manual methods, while improved associations with survival were observed in patients with certain tumor types identified as PD-L1–positive using AI-powered scoring only. Our study demonstrates the potential for implementation of digital pathology-based methods in future clinical practice to identify more patients who would benefit from treatment with immuno-oncology therapy compared with current guidelines using manual assessment. © 2022, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85134359209"

Recently, large experimental databases have become publicly available with amyloidogenic labels. Using these data sets for training and testing purposes, one may build artificial intelligence (AI)-based classifiers for predicting the amyloid state of peptides. In our previous work (Biomolecules 2021, 11, 500), we described the Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based Budapest Amyloid Predictor (https://pitgroup.org/bap). Here, we apply the Budapest Amyloid Predictor for discovering numerous amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic hexapeptide patterns with accuracy between 80% and 84%, as surprising and succinct novel rules for further understanding the amyloid state of peptides. For example, we have shown that for any independently mutated residue (position marked by ""x""), the patterns CxFLWx, FxFLFx, or xxIVIV are predicted to be amyloidogenic, while those of PxDxxx, xxKxEx, and xxPQxx are nonamyloidogenic. We note that each amyloidogenic pattern with two x's (e.g.,CxFLWx) describes succinctly 202= 400 hexapeptides, while the nonamyloidogenic patterns comprising four point mutations (e.g.,PxDxxx) give 204= 160 000 hexapeptides in total. We also examine the restricted substitutions for positions ""x"" from subclasses of proteinogenic amino acid residues; for example, if ""x"" is substituted with hydrophobic amino acids, then there exist patterns containing three x's, like MxVVxx, predicted to be amyloidogenic. If we can choose for the x positions any hydrophobic amino acids, except the ""structure breaker"" proline, then we get amyloid patterns with five x positions, for example, xxxFxx, each corresponding to 32 768 hexapeptides.

Engineers of AI systems are increasingly expected to go beyond the traditions of requirement specifications, taking into account broader societal contexts and their complexities. In this paper we present findings from a hackathon event conducted with working engineers, exploring the gaps between existing guidelines and recommendations for addressing ethical issues with respect to AI technologies and the realities experienced by the engineers in practice. We found that when faced with the uncertainties of how to recognize and navigate ethical issues and challenges, engineers looked to identify the responsibilities that need to be in place to sustain trust and to hold the relevant parties to account for their misdeeds. We re-envision familiar engineering practices as nodes of certainty to accommodate the needs of responsible and ethical AI. Despite the desire for mechanisms for sustaining certainty in how to build AI technology responsibly by providing frameworks for action and accountability, there remains a need to ensure just enough spaces and opportunities to cultivate reasonable doubt. Space and capacity to doubt accepted certainties, in fact, is the very process of ethics, necessary for holding to account our standards, guidelines, and checklists as technology and society co-evolve. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-85122268273"

Qualitative data was collected in interviews with seven experts from four companies, and the data was analysed using inductive content analysis. The four main areas of challenges were ambiguous regulations, inequalities in human learning, ethical dilemmas in machine learning (ML) and lack of ability to assess consequences in society. According to the studied companies, AI regulations are difficult to understand and implement. There is also much to be done in terms of reliability, transparency, and safety. Consequently, companies suggested that AI-based products should be more preventive, safe, explicable, and equally accessible. Sufficient information, multi-professional support also within company, global collaboration, sharing best practices, and general discussion were emphasised. The results show that EdTech companies are aware of their ethical challenges, and their responsibility as disseminators of information.

From unlocking our smartphones with our faces to receiving film recommendations on streaming platforms, AI is part of our routines. In recent years, a widespread adoption of AI technologies both by public and private agencies has been observed. Notwithstanding the many conveniences it has created, the use of AI also involves many risks for people individually and for society as a whole. For instance, it may jeopardise fundamental rights such as privacy and data protection or even intensify existing discrimination against minorities. For this reason, various nations are now facing the challenge of regulating AI without limiting its development. In terms of data protection, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been consistently applied and enforced in the European Union (EU) and has inspired many other data protection laws that came after it, such as the one in Brazil. In Brazil, the General Data Protection Law (LGPD) has finally come into force and is slowly being enforced. In 2021, a series of legislative initiatives concerning the development and use of AI systems drew the attention of governments, academics and the tech industry around the world. In the EU, the European Commission released a proposal for regulation in April that presents harmonised rules on AI. Meanwhile, in Brazil, in September, the Chamber of Deputies approved a rather superficial bill aiming to regulate AI in the country. Thus, one can wonder: what is the impact of data protection laws on AI regulations? And how could Brazil benefit once again from following the EU's lead on regulating AI? In order to answer these questions, this article begins by explaining the concept of AI. It then presents the relation between AI and privacy and data protection as well as the main principles that guide privacy and data protection under both EU and Brazilian data protection laws. Subsequently, it introduces the EU legal framework for AI and focuses on the risk-based approach. Later, it presents the proposed Brazilian bill, focusing on its main principles from a comparative perspective with the EU. Finally, it will conclude how Brazil can benefit from taking inspiration from the EU experience on AI regulation.  © 2022 Published by OUP and CH Beck on behalf of GRUR e.V.

Raman spectroscopy-based detectors are widely used but have many limitations. The Raman spectrum changes unpredictably due to various environmental factors, and it is hard for detectors to make appropriate judgments about new chemical substances without prior information. Thus, the existing detectors with inflexible techniques based on determined rules cannot deal with such problems flexibly and reactively. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based detection techniques can be good alternatives to the existing techniques for chemical agent detection. To build AI-based detection systems, sufficient amounts of data for training are required, but it is not easy to produce and handle fatal chemical agents, which causes difficulty in securing data in advance. To overcome the limitations, in this paper, we propose the distributed Raman spectrum data augmentation system that leverages federated learning (FL) with deep generative models, such as generative adversarial network (GAN) and autoencoder. Furthermore, the proposed system utilizes various additional techniques in combination to generate a large number of Raman spectrum data with reality along with diversity. We implemented the proposed system and conducted diverse experiments to evaluate the system. The evaluation results validated that the proposed system can train the models more quickly through cooperation among decentralized troops without exchanging raw data and generate realistic Raman spectrum data well. Moreover, we confirmed that the classification model on the proposed system performed learning much faster and outperformed the existing systems. © 2022 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85144525478"

Business leaders thus face the question of how to best reap the benefits of automation whilst managing the associated risks. As a first step, many companies have committed themselves to various sets of ethics principles aimed at guiding the design and use of AI systems. So far so good. But how can well-intentioned ethical principles be translated into effective practice? And what challenges await companies that attempt to operationalize AI governance? In this article, we address these questions by drawing on our first-hand experience of shaping and driving the roll-out of AI governance within AstraZeneca, a biopharmaceutical company. The examples we discuss highlight challenges that any organization attempting to operationalize AI governance will have to face. These include questions concerning how to define the material scope of AI governance, how to harmonize standards across decentralized organizations, and how to measure the impact of specific AI governance initiatives. By showcasing how AstraZeneca managed these operational questions, we hope to provide project managers, CIOs, AI practitioners, and data privacy officers responsible for designing and implementing AI governance frameworks within other organizations with generalizable best practices. In essence, companies seeking to operationalize AI governance are encouraged to build on existing policies and governance structures, use pragmatic and action-oriented terminology, focus on risk management in development and procurement, and empower employees through continuous education and change management.

Automated methods of detecting abnormal cervical cells were established because manual identification requires skilled pathologists and is time consuming and prone to error. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for the prediction, screening, and diagnosis of cervical cancer and pre-cancerous lesions. Materials and Methods: Comprehensive searches were performed on three databases: Medline, Web of Science Core Collection (Indexes = SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A & HCI Timespan) and Scopus to find papers published until July 2022. Articles that applied any AI technique for the prediction, screening, and diagnosis of cervical cancer were included in the review. No time restriction was applied. Articles were searched, screened, incorporated, and analyzed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Results: The primary search yielded 2538 articles. After screening and evaluation of eligibility, 117 studies were incorporated in the review. AI techniques were found to play a significant role in screening systems for pre-cancerous and cancerous cervical lesions. The accuracy of the algorithms in predicting cervical cancer varied from 70% to 100%. AI techniques make a distinction between cancerous and normal Pap smears with 80–100% accuracy. AI is expected to serve as a practical tool for doctors in making accurate clinical diagnoses. The reported sensitivity and specificity of AI in colposcopy for the detection of CIN2+ were 71.9–98.22% and 51.8–96.2%, respectively. Conclusion: The present review highlights the acceptable performance of AI systems in the prediction, screening, or detection of cervical cancer and pre-cancerous lesions, especially when faced with a paucity of specialized centers or medical resources. In combination with human evaluation, AI could serve as a helpful tool in the interpretation of cervical smears or images. © 2022 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85147393303"

However, these DCNNs have primarily been trained and tested on device-specific databases with standardized electrode positions and uniform sampling frequencies. This work explores the possibility of training a DCNN for Atrial Fibrillation (AF) detection on a database of single‑lead ECG rhythm strips extracted from resting 12‑lead ECGs. We then test the performance of the DCNN on recordings from ambulatory ECG devices with different recording leads and sampling frequencies. We developed an extensive proprietary resting 12‑lead ECG dataset of 549,211 patients. This dataset was randomly split into a training set of 494,289 patients and a testing set of the remaining 54,922 patients. We trained a 34-layer convolutional DCNN to detect AF and other arrhythmias on this dataset. The DCNN was then validated on two Physionet databases commonly used to benchmark automated ECG algorithms (1) MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and (2) MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database. Validation was performed following the EC57 guidelines, with performance assessed by gross episode and duration sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV). Finally, validation was also performed on a selection of rhythm strips from an ambulatory ECG patch that a committee of board-certified cardiologists annotated. On MIT-BIH, The DCNN achieved a sensitivity of 100% and 84% PPV in detecting episodes of AF. and 100% sensitivity and 94% PPV in quantifying AF episode duration. On AFDB, The DCNN achieved a sensitivity of 94% and PPV of 98% in detecting episodes of AF, and 98% sensitivity and 100% PPV in quantifying AF episode duration. On the patch database, the DCNN demonstrated performance that was closely comparable to that of a cardiologist. The results indicate that DCNN models can learn features that generalize between resting 12‑lead and ambulatory ECG recordings, allowing DCNNs to be device agnostic for detecting arrhythmias from single‑lead ECG recordings and enabling a range of clinical applications. © 2022","2-s2.0-85140377579"

All the banks in a bid to improve their revenues have started investing in AI through better customer engagement. The key focus of the banks is also to ensure compliance and proactively detecting and preventing the frauds. AI based Anti-money laundering applications are the solutions for the same. AI has also helped banks to explore the customer preferences and also serve their issues in real time. Besides customer service and operational costs, the banks have started using AI in risk management. Risk Management for banks includes compliance to Anti-Money laundering measures as specified by Reserve Bank of India and other regulatory bodies from time to time. The initiatives taken by the banks in the adoption of AI has been discussed in this paper. Anti-money laundering applications are programmed with a set of rules, process, laws and regulation helping the financial institutions to detect income from illegal sources. The banks have also benefited from AI enabled Chabot support system which responds to the identified query with most suitable reply. The paper also discusses about the challenges in the implementation of AI which includes unwillingness to switch to new methods, up skilling of the workforce. Artificial Intelligence is a new normal for most of the industries. Financial industry is no exception. With the help of advanced technology, banks and non-banking finance companies have been able to lower their operational costs and surpass the customer expectations. © 2022 American Institute of Physics Inc..

The acceptance of AI technologies depends on both the Human-AI (HAI) interaction and the ethics of AI. HAI interaction significantly affects the acceptance of AI-enabled solutions. Many guidelines have been developed to support HAI interaction design, including Microsoft's Guidelines for HAI interaction. On the other hand, many ethics by design guidelines were developed, such as the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI (EGTAI) developed by European Commission. However, there is less discussion about the possible relations between these two sets of guidelines for developing AI-enabled solutions. This study aims to analyze how current AI-enabled solutions comply with these two guidelines using a case study approach. To realize this aim, we conducted a co-evaluation workshop investigating how two existing AI-enabled apps, Strava and CoronaMelder, comply with these two guidelines. In this workshop, four participants with prior knowledge of designing with AI were asked to analyze the two cases by identifying whether these guidelines were met. The workshop results implied that when HAI interactions are designed according to the HAI interaction guidelines, they do not necessarily align with the EGTAI guidelines and vice versa.  © 2022 Owner/Author.","2-s2.0-85185391384"

We focus on algorithms that can identify persons with suicidal ideation based on their postings on social media platforms and investigate whether private companies like Facebook are justified in using these. To find out if that is the case, we start with providing two examples for AI-based means of suicide prevention in social media. Subsequently, we frame suicide prevention as an issue of beneficence, develop two fictional cases to explore the scope of the principle of beneficence and apply the lessons learned to Facebook’s employment of AI for suicide prevention. We show that Facebook is neither acting under an obligation of beneficence nor acting meritoriously. This insight leads us to the general question of who is entitled to help. We conclude that private companies like Facebook can play an important role in suicide prevention, if they comply with specific rules which we derive from beneficence and autonomy as core principles of biomedical ethics. At the same time, public bodies have an obligation to create appropriate framework conditions for AI-based tools of suicide prevention. As an outlook we depict how cooperation between public and private institutions can make an important contribution to combating suicide and, in this way, put the principle of beneficence into practice. © 2022, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85142894012"

AI-based applications can offer tools to examine high-volume data to inform predictive analytics that supports complex decision-making processes. Time-sensitive trauma and emergency contexts are often challenging. The study aims to investigate trauma and emergency surgeons’ knowledge and perception of using AI-based tools in clinical decision-making processes. Methods: An online survey grounded on literature regarding AI-enabled surgical decision-making aids was created by a multidisciplinary committee and endorsed by the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES). The survey was advertised to 917 WSES members through the society’s website and Twitter profile. Results: 650 surgeons from 71 countries in five continents participated in the survey. Results depict the presence of technology enthusiasts and skeptics and surgeons’ preference toward more classical decision-making aids like clinical guidelines, traditional training, and the support of their multidisciplinary colleagues. A lack of knowledge about several AI-related aspects emerges and is associated with mistrust. Discussion: The trauma and emergency surgical community is divided into those who firmly believe in the potential of AI and those who do not understand or trust AI-enabled surgical decision-making aids. Academic societies and surgical training programs should promote a foundational, working knowledge of clinical AI. © The Author(s) 2023.","2-s2.0-85145428951"

This scoping review aimed to identify actionable guidance for those closely involved in AI-based prediction model (AIPM) development, evaluation and implementation including software engineers, data scientists, and healthcare professionals and to identify potential gaps in this guidance. We performed a scoping review of the relevant literature providing guidance or quality criteria regarding the development, evaluation, and implementation of AIPMs using a comprehensive multi-stage screening strategy. PubMed, Web of Science, and the ACM Digital Library were searched, and AI experts were consulted. Topics were extracted from the identified literature and summarized across the six phases at the core of this review: (1) data preparation, (2) AIPM development, (3) AIPM validation, (4) software development, (5) AIPM impact assessment, and (6) AIPM implementation into daily healthcare practice. From 2683 unique hits, 72 relevant guidance documents were identified. Substantial guidance was found for data preparation, AIPM development and AIPM validation (phases 1–3), while later phases clearly have received less attention (software development, impact assessment and implementation) in the scientific literature. The six phases of the AIPM development, evaluation and implementation cycle provide a framework for responsible introduction of AI-based prediction models in healthcare. Additional domain and technology specific research may be necessary and more practical experience with implementing AIPMs is needed to support further guidance. © 2022, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85122738619"

On conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, these tumours are observed as irregular enhancing lesions with areas of infiltrating tumour and cortical expansion. More advanced imaging techniques including diffusion-weighted MRI, perfusion-weighted MRI, MR spectroscopy and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging have found widespread application to diagnostic challenges in the setting of first diagnosis, treatment planning and follow-up. This review aims to educate readers with regard to the strengths and weaknesses of the clinical application of these imaging techniques. For example, this review shows that the (semi) quantitative analysis of the mentioned advanced imaging tools was found useful for assessing tumour aggressiveness and tumour extent, and aids in the differentiation of tumour progression from treatment-related effects. Although these techniques may aid in the diagnostic work-up and (post-)treatment phase of glioblastoma, so far no unequivocal imaging strategy is available. Furthermore, the use and further development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools could greatly enhance neuroradiological practice by automating labour-intensive tasks such as tumour measurements, and by providing additional diagnostic information such as prediction of tumour genotype. Nevertheless, due to the fact that advanced imaging and AI-diagnostics is not part of response assessment criteria, there is no harmonised guidance on their use, while at the same time the lack of standardisation severely hampers the definition of uniform guidelines. © 2023, British Institute of Radiology.

One of the proposals is related and limited to liability for artificial intelligent (AI) systems, but the other contains nothing less than a full revision of the 1985 Product Liability Directive, which lies at the heart of European tort law. Whereas the current Product Liability Directive largely followed the model of US law, the revised version breaks new ground. It does not limit itself to the expansion of the concept of product to include intangible digital goods, such as software and data as well as related services, important enough in itself, but also targets the new intermediaries of e-commerce as liable parties. As such, the proposal for a new product liability directive is a great leap forward and has the potential to grow into a worldwide benchmark in the field.

We describe herein the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) system for VSPs enabling students to practice their history taking skills. Methods: Our system consists of (1) Automated Speech Recognition (ASR), (2) hybrid AI for question identification, (3) classifier to choose between the two systems, and (4) automated speech generation. We analyzed the accuracy of the ASR, the two AI systems, the classifier, and student feedback with 620 first year medical students from 2018 to 2021. Results: System accuracy improved from ∼75% in 2018 to ∼90% in 2021 as refinements in algorithms and additional training data were utilized. Student feedback was positive, and most students felt that practicing with the VSPs was a worthwhile experience. Conclusion: We have developed a novel hybrid dialogue system that enables artificially intelligent VSPs to correctly answer student questions at levels comparable with human SPs.

Although myocardial ischemia affects the configuration of the QRS complex and the STT waveform, current guidelines primarily focus on ST segment amplitude, which constitutes a missed opportunity and may explain the suboptimal diagnostic performance of the ECG. This possible opportunity and the low cost and ease of use of the ECG provide compelling motivation to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of the ECG to ischemia detection. This paper describes numerous computational ECG methods and approaches that have been shown to dramatically increase ECG sensitivity to ischemia detection. Briefly, these emerging approaches can be conceptually grouped into one of the following four approaches: (1) leveraging novel ECG waveform features and signatures indicative of ischemic injury other than the classical ST-T amplitude measures; (2) applying body surface potentials mapping (BSPM)-based approaches to enhance the spatial coverage of the surface ECG to detecting ischemia; (3) developing an inverse ECG solution to reconstruct anatomical models of activation and recovery pathways to detect and localize injury currents; and (4) exploring artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques to harvest ECG waveform signatures of ischemia. We present recent advances, shortcomings, and future opportunities for each of these emerging ECG methods. Future research should focus on the prospective clinical testing of these approaches to establish clinical utility and to expedite potential translation into clinical practice. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","2-s2.0-85136258519"

In particular, multiobjective optimization (MOO) is necessary in resolving the competition among different nodes sharing limited wireless network resources. A unified coordination mechanism is essential such that individual nodes conduct the opportunistic maximization of heterogeneous local objectives for efficient distributed resource allocation. To such a problem, this article proposes an artificial intelligence (AI)-based framework, which is termed as MOO strategy for AI-aided IoT communications (MOSAIC). This framework enables to tackle numerous MOO tasks in IoT network management with simple reconfiguration of learning rules. In this strategy, a component unit associated with an individual network node includes a pair of deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn optimal local functions responsible for calculation and distributed coordination, respectively. The resultant AI module swarm called DNN tiles realizes the node cooperation that collectively seeks distributed MOO calculation rules. The advantage of MOSAIC is characterized by Pareto tradeoffs among conflicting performance metrics in diverse wireless networking configurations subject to severe interference and distinct criteria for multiple targets.  © 2022 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85124711596"

Advances in wireless technologies enable remote delivery of light to tumors, but suffer from key limitations, including low levels of tissue penetration and photosensitizer activation. Here, we introduce DeepLabCut (DLC)-informed low-power wireless telemetry with an integrated thermal/light simulation platform that overcomes the above constraints. The simulator produces an optimized combination of wavelengths and light sources, and DLC-assisted wireless telemetry uses the parameters from the simulator to enable adequate illumination of tumors through high-throughput (<20 mice) and multi-wavelength operation. Together, they establish a range of guidelines for effective PDT regimen design.

In addition, pharmacy services that link doctors and patients are becoming essential in improving patient satisfaction. However, the existing internet hospital pharmacy service mode relies primarily on manual operations, making it cumbersome, inefficient, and high-risk. Objective: To establish an internet hospital pharmacy service mode based on artificial intelligence (AI) and provide new insights into pharmacy services in internet hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An AI-based internet hospital pharmacy service mode was established. Initially, prescription rules were formulated and embedded into the internet hospital system to review the prescriptions using AI. Then, the “medicine pick-up code,” which is a Quick Response (QR) code that represents a specific offline self-pick-up order, was created. Patients or volunteers could pick up medications at an offline hospital or drugstore by scanning the QR code through the window and wait for the dispensing machine or pharmacist to dispense the drugs. Moreover, the medication consultation function was also operational. Results: The established internet pharmacy service mode had four major functional segments: online drug catalog search, prescription preview by AI, drug dispensing and distribution, and AI-based medication consultation response. The qualified rate of AI preview was 83.65%. Among the 16.35% inappropriate prescriptions, 49% were accepted and modified by physicians proactively and 51.00% were passed after pharmacists intervened. The “offline self-pick-up” mode was preferred by 86% of the patients for collecting their medication in the internet hospital, which made the QR code to be fully applied. A total of 426 medication consultants were served, and 48.83% of them consulted outside working hours. The most frequently asked questions during consultations were about the internet hospital dispensing process, followed by disease diagnosis, and patient education. Therefore, an AI-based medication consultation was proposed to respond immediately when pharmacists were unavailable. Conclusion: The established AI-based internet hospital pharmacy service mode could provide references for pharmacy departments during the COVID-19 pandemic. The significance of this study lies in ensuring safe/rational use of medicines and raising pharmacists’ working efficiency.

Additionally, utilising advanced sensing technologies based on flexible and innovative biocompatible materials in wearable devices allows high accuracy and precision measurement of biological signals. Furthermore, applying real-time Machine Learning algorithms to highly accurate physiological parameters allows precise identification of unusual patterns in the data to provide health event predictions and warnings for timely intervention. However, in the predominantly adopted architectures, health event predictions based on Machine Learning are typically obtained by leveraging Cloud infrastructures characterised by shortcomings such as delayed response times and privacy issues. Fortunately, recent works highlight that a new paradigm based on Edge Computing technologies and on-device Artificial Intelligence significantly improve the latency and privacy issues. Applying this new paradigm to personalised healthcare architectures can significantly improve their efficiency and efficacy. Therefore, this paper reviews existing IoT healthcare architectures that utilise wearable devices and subsequently presents a scalable and modular system architecture to leverage emerging technologies to solve identified shortcomings. The defined architecture includes ultrathin, skin-compatible, flexible, high precision piezoelectric sensors, low-cost communication technologies, on-device intelligence, Edge Intelligence, and Edge Computing technologies. To provide development guidelines and define a consistent reference architecture for improved scalable wearable IoT-based critical healthcare architectures, this manuscript outlines the essential functional and non-functional requirements based on deductions from existing architectures and emerging technology trends. The presented system architecture can be applied to many scenarios, including ambient assisted living, where continuous surveillance and issuance of timely warnings can afford independence to the elderly and chronically ill. We conclude that the distribution and modularity of architecture layers, local AI-based elaboration, and data packaging consistency are the more essential functional requirements for critical healthcare application use cases. We also identify fast response time, utility, comfort, and low cost as the essential non-functional requirements for the defined system architecture. © 2022 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85140005157"

This paper proposes an adaptive personalized E-learning platform with a novel combination of Visual/Aural/Read, Write/Kinesthetic (VARK) presentation or gamification and exercises difficulty scaffolding through skipping/hiding/ reattempting. Cognitive, behavior and affective adaptation means are included in developing a dynamic learner model, which detects and corrects each student’s learning style and cognitive level. As adaptation targets, the platform provides adaptive content presentation in two groups (VARK and gamification), adaptive exercises navigation and adaptive feedback. To achieve its goal, the platform utilizes a Deep Q-Network Reinforcement Learning (DQN-RL) and an online rule-based decision making implementation. The platform interfaces front-end dedicated website and back-end adaptation algorithms. An improvement in learning effectiveness is achieved comparing the post-test to the pre-test in a pilot experiment for grade 3 mathematics curriculum. Both groups witnessed academic performance and satisfaction level improvements, most importantly, for the students who started the experiment with a relatively low performance. VARK group witnessed a slightly more improvement and higher satisfaction level, since interactive activities and games in the kinesthetic presentation can provide engagement, while keeping other presentation styles available, when needed. © 2022, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85133167384"

The main challenge for robotic disassembly is the uncertainties of product structures, models, and conditions. The ability of a robotic disassembly system to learn new product structures and reason about existing knowledge of product structure is vital to addressing this challenge. This paper presents an effective learning framework and demonstrates the system's ability to learn relevant information for the disassembly of LCD monitors. The learning algorithm uses a database of previous disassembly experience of the product family and analyses it to create rules and relations between the components and disassembly concepts before expanding the generic ontology for future disassembly runs. The results show a significant increase from 11% to 87% in successful part identification of LCD monitors after being trained on past disassembly experience. The proposed method can greatly aid robotic disassembly of any product family. Note to Practitioners - Robotic systems struggle to disassemble electronic waste due to the complexity and uncertainties in end-of-life products and variations in models and parts. An artificially intelligent method is proposed to enable a robotic disassembly system to address these uncertainties. The method uses a computing technique resembling the cognitive reasoning of a human mind in the form of a map of disassembly concepts connected by relationships. Artificial learning by the robotic system occurs by collecting data from previous disassembly runs of a product, analyzing the data, and expanding the map of knowledge with new concepts and relational rules found. The approach is tested on the robotic disassembly system's ability to identify parts of LCD monitors which possess uncertainties. An improvement from 11% of successful part identification to 87% is found, which demonstrate that learning has taken place. This approach will be implemented in a larger robotic disassembly system and tested with real robotic disassembly runs in the near future.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85124749706"

The trials and tribulations of the healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic have set the stage for shifting healthcare from a physical to a cyber-physical space. A physician can now remotely monitor a patient, admitting them only if they meet certain thresholds, thereby reducing the total number of admissions at the hospital. Coordination, communication, and resource management have been core issues for any industry. However, it is most accurate in healthcare. Both systems and providers are exhausted under the burden of increasing data and complexity of care delivery, increasing costs, and financial burden. Simultaneously, there is a digital transformation of healthcare in the making. This transformation provides an opportunity to create systems of care that are artificial intelligence-enabled. Healthcare resources can be utilized more justly. The wastage of financial and intellectual resources in an overcrowded healthcare system can be avoided by implementing IoT, telehealth, and AI/ML-based algorithms. It is imperative to consider the design principles of the patient's journey while simultaneously prioritizing a better user experience to alleviate physician concerns. This paper discusses the entire blueprint of the AI/ML-assisted patient journey and its impact on healthcare provision.

The argument draws on the institutionalist approach in philosophy and business ethics defending a 'division of moral labor' between governments and the private sector (Rawls 2001; Scheffler and Munoz-Dardé 2005). The goal and main contribution of this article is to explain how this approach can provide ethical guidelines to the AI industry and to highlight the limits of self-regulation. In what follows, I discuss three institutionalist claims. First, principles of AI ethics should be validated through legitimate democratic processes. Second, compliance with these principles should be secured in a stable way. Third, their implementation in practice should be as efficient as possible. If we accept these claims, there are good reasons to conclude that, in many cases, governments implementing hard regulation are in principle (if not yet in practice) the best instruments to secure an ethical development of AI systems. Where adequate regulation exists, firms should respect the law. But when regulation does not yet exist, helping governments build adequate regulation should be businesses' ethical priority, not self-regulation. © 2021 Thomas Ferretti, published by De Gruyter.","2-s2.0-85112267578"

Electronic searches were conducted across three major app stores and the selected apps were evaluated by three independent raters. A total of 473 apps were found and 80 of them were selected for review based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. An app rating tool is devised to evaluate the selected apps. Our rating tool assesses the apps essential features, AI based advanced functionalities and software quality characteristics required for food consumption tracking and recommendations, as well as their usefulness to general users. The rating tool's internal consistency, as well as inter- and intra-rater reliability among raters, are also calculated. Users’ comments from the app stores are collected and evaluated to better understand their expectations and perspectives. Following an evaluation of the assessed applications, design considerations that emphasize automation-based approaches using artificial intelligence are proposed. According to our assessment, most mobile apps in the app stores do not satisfy the overall requirements for tracking food consumption and recommendations. “Foodvisor” is the only app that can automatically recognise food items, and compute the recommended volume and nutritional information of that food item. However, these features need to be improvised in the food consumption tracking and recommendation apps.

However, most of the AI systems developed to date are still in the experimental stages, with only a few having achieved clinical applications. There are a number of reasons for this phenomenon, including security, privacy, poor pervasiveness, trust and explainability concerns.

The European Union (EU) is tackling these issues with the existing legal framework and drafting new regulations, such as the proposed AI Act. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) partly regulates AI systems, with rules on processing personal data and protecting data subjects against solely automated decision-making. In healthcare services, (automated) decisions are made more frequently and rapidly. However, medical research focuses on innovation and efficacy, with less direct decisions on individuals. Therefore, the GDPR’s restrictions on solely automated decision-making apply mainly to healthcare services, and the rights of patients and research participants may significantly differ. The proposed AI Act introduced a risk-based approach to AI systems based on the principles of ethical AI. We analysed the complex connection between the GDPR and AI Act, highlighting the main issues and finding ways to harmonise the principles of data protection and ethical AI. The proposed AI Act may complement the GDPR in healthcare services and medical research.

With this work, we propose a method for evaluation of similarity between rules, which identifies similar rules, or very different ones, by exploiting techniques developed for Natural Language Processing (NLP). We evaluate the similarity of if-then rules by interpreting them as sentences and generating a similarity matrix acting as an enabler for domain experts to analyse the generated rules and thus discover new knowledge. Rule similarity may be applied to rule analysis and manipulation in different scenarios: the first one deals with rule analysis and interpretation, while the second scenario refers to pruning unnecessary rules within a single ruleset.

Consequently, AI systems increasingly affect humans, yet many state-of-the-art systems lack transparency and thus, deny the individual’s “right to explanation”. As a remedy, researchers and practitioners have developed explainable AI, which provides reasoning on how AI systems infer individual predictions. However, with recent legal initiatives demanding comprehensive explainability throughout the (development of an) AI system, we argue that the pre-processing stage has been unjustifiably neglected and should receive greater attention in current efforts to establish explainability. In this paper, we focus on introducing explainability to an integral part of the pre-processing stage: feature selection. Specifically, we build upon design science research to develop a design framework for explainable feature selection. We instantiate the design framework in a running software artifact and evaluate it in two focus group sessions. Our artifact helps organizations to persuasively justify feature selection to stakeholders and, thus, comply with upcoming AI legislation. We further provide researchers and practitioners with a design framework consisting of meta-requirements and design principles for explainable feature selection. © 2022, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85142888081"

Particularly, unknown disparities based on demographic factors could encrypt currently existing inequalities worsening patient care for some groups. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we present a systematic review of ‘fair’ deep learning modeling techniques for natural and medical image applications which were published between year 2011 to 2021. Our search used Covidence review management software and incorporates articles from PubMed, IEEE, and ACM search engines and three reviewers independently review the manuscripts. Results: Inter-rater agreement was 0.89 and conflicts were resolved by obtaining consensus between three reviewers. Our search initially retrieved 692 studies but after careful screening, our review included 22 manuscripts that carried four prevailing themes; ‘fair’ training dataset generation (4/22), representation learning (10/22), model disparity across institutions (5/22) and model fairness with respect to patient demographics (3/22). We benchmark the current literature regarding fairness in AI-based image analysis and highlighted the existing challenges. We observe that often discussion regarding fairness are limited to analyzing existing bias without further establishing methodologies to overcome model disparities. Conclusion: Based on the current research trends, exploration of adversarial learning for demographic/camera/institution agnostic models is an important direction to minimize disparity gaps for imaging.

One major cause for such low impact is the lack of model transparency, significantly limiting the AI adoption in real clinical practice. To solve this problem, AI models need to be explained to users. Thus, we have conducted a comprehensive study of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) using PRISMA technology. Our findings suggest that XAI can improve model performance, instill trust in the users, and assist users in decision-making. In this systematic review, we introduce common XAI techniques and their utility with specific examples of their application. We discuss the evaluation of XAI results because it is an important step for maximizing the value of AI-based clinical decision support systems. Additionally, we present the traditional, modern, and advanced XAI models to demonstrate the evolution of novel techniques. Finally, we provide a best practice guideline that developers can refer to during the model experimentation. We also offer potential solutions with specific examples for common challenges in AI model experimentation. This comprehensive review, hopefully, can promote AI adoption in biomedicine and healthcare.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85133767411"

Using artificial Intelligence (AI) to read mammography images has been shown to predict breast cancer risk with higher accuracy than alternative approaches including polygenic risk scores (PRS), raising the question whether AI-based screening is more cost-effective than screening based on PRS or existing guidelines. This study provides the first evidence to shed light on this important question. Methods: This study is a model-based economic evaluation. We used a hybrid decision tree/microsimulation model to compare the cost-effectiveness of eight strategies of mammography screening for women aged 40–49 (screening beyond age 50 follows existing guidelines). Six of these strategies were defined by combinations of risk prediction approaches (AI, PRS or family history) and screening frequency for low-risk women (no screening or biennial screening). The other two strategies involved annual screening for all women and no screening, respectively. Data used to populate the model were sourced from the published literature. Results: Risk prediction using AI followed by no screening for low-risk women is the most cost-effective strategy. It dominates (i.e., costs more and generates fewer quality adjusted life years (QALYs)) strategies for risk prediction using PRS followed by no screening or biennial screening for low-risk women, risk prediction using AI or family history followed by biennial screening for low-risk women, and annual screening for all women. It also extendedly dominates (i.e., achieves higher QALYs at a lower incremental cost per QALY) the strategy for risk prediction using family history followed by no screening for low-risk women. Meanwhile, it is cost-effective versus no screening, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $23,755 per QALY gained. Conclusions: Risk prediction using AI followed by no breast cancer screening for low-risk women is the most cost-effective strategy. This finding can be explained by AI’s ability to identify high-risk women more accurately than PRS and family history (which reduces the possibility of delayed breast cancer diagnosis) and fewer false-positive diagnoses from not screening low-risk women. © 2022, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85129635246"

Cephalometric analysis has been significantly facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years. For digital cephalograms, linear measurements are conducted based on the length calibration process, which has not been automatized in current AI-based systems. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an automated calibration system for lateral cephalometry to conduct linear measurements more efficiently. Approach. This system was based on deep learning algorithms and medical priors of a stable structure, the anterior cranial base (Sella-Nasion). First, a two-stage cascade convolutional neural network was constructed based on 2860 cephalograms to locate sella, nasion, and 2 ruler points in regions of interest. Further, Sella-Nasion distance was applied to estimate the distance between ruler points, and then pixels size of cephalograms was attained for linear measurements. The accuracy of automated landmark localization, ruler length prediction, and linear measurement based on automated calibration was evaluated with statistical analysis. Main results. First, for AI-located points, 99.6% of S and 86% of N points deviated less than 2 mm from the ground truth, and 99% of ruler points deviated less than 0.3 mm from the ground truth. Also, this system correctly predicted the ruler length of 98.95% of samples. Based on automated calibration, 11 linear cephalometric measurements of the test set showed no difference from manual calibration (p > 0.05). Significance. This system was the first reported in the literature to conduct automated calibration with high accuracy and showed high potential for clinical application in cephalometric analysis. © 2022 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","2-s2.0-85142501541"

In fact, these algorithms can exhibit unwanted discriminatory behaviours that create unfair outcomes when the software is used, such as giving privilege to one group of users over another (e.g., males vs. females). Mitigating algorithmic bias during the development life cycle of AI-enabled software is crucial given that any bias in these algorithms is inherited by the software systems using them. However, previous work has shown that mitigating bias can impact the performance of such systems. Therefore, we propose herein a novel use of soft computing for improving AI-enabled software fairness. Specifically, we exploit multi-objective search, as opposed to previous work optimising fairness only, to strike an optimal balance between reducing gender bias and improving semantic correctness of word embedding models, which are at the core of many AI-enabled systems. To assess the effectiveness of our proposal, we carry out a thorough empirical study based on the most recent best practice for the evaluation of search-based approaches and AI-enabled software. We explore seven different search-based approaches, and benchmark them against both baseline and state-of-the-art approaches applied to a popular and widely used word embedding model, namely WORD2VEC. Our results show that multi-objective search outperforms single-objective search, and generates word embeddings that are strictly better than the original ones in both objectives, bias and semantic correctness, for all investigated cases. Additionally, our approach generates word embeddings of higher semantic correctness than those generated by using state-of-the-art techniques in all cases, while also achieving a higher degree of fairness in 67% of the cases. These findings show the feasibility and effectiveness of multi-objective search as a tool for engineers to incorporate fair and accurate word embedding models in their AI-enabled systems. © 2022 The Author(s)","2-s2.0-85145659097"

The Cancer-Moonshot community aims to reduce the cancer death rate by half in the next 25 years and wants to improve the lives of cancer-affected people. Cancer mortality can be reduced if detected early and treated appropriately. Cancers like breast cancer and cervical cancer have high cure probabilities when treated early in accordance with best practices. Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into cancer research is currently addressing many of the challenges where medical experts fail to bring cancer to control and cure, and the outcomes are quite encouraging. AI offers many tools and platforms to facilitate more understanding and tackling of this life-threatening disease. AI-based systems can help pathologists in diagnosing cancer more accurately and consistently, reducing the case error rates. Predictive-AI models can estimate the likelihood for a person to get cancer by identifying the risk factors. Big data, together with AI, can enable medical experts to develop customized treatments for cancer patients. The side effects from this kind of customized therapy will be less severe in comparison with the generalized therapies. However, many of these AI tools will remain ineffective in fighting against cancer and saving the lives of millions of patients unless they are accessible and understandable to biologists, oncologists, and other medical cancer researchers.

This review provided a critical summary of the existing literature on the machine and deep learning methods for the built environment over the past decade, with special reference to holistic approaches. Different AI-based techniques employed to resolve interconnected problems related to heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and enhance building performances were reviewed, including energy forecasting and management, indoor air quality and occupancy comfort/satisfaction prediction, occupancy detection and recognition, and fault detection and diagnosis. The present study explored existing AI-based techniques focusing on the framework, methodology, and performance. The literature highlighted that selecting the most suitable machine learning and deep learning model for solving a problem could be challenging. The recent explosive growth experienced by the research area has led to hundreds of machine learning algorithms being applied to building performance-related studies.

This makes it difficult to find an optimal algorithm for a specific task or case. The studies also employed a wide range of evaluation metrics, adding to the challenge. Further developments and more specific guidelines are required for the built environment field to encourage best practices in evaluating and selecting models. The literature also showed that while machine and deep learning had been successfully applied in building energy efficiency research, most of the studies are still at the experimental or testing stage, and there are limited studies which implemented machine and deep learning strategies in actual buildings and conducted the post-occupancy evaluation. © 2022","2-s2.0-85136150981"

Therefore, research streams such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) or component-based software engineering provide researchers and practitioners with construction guidelines for selected architectural characteristics. Current systems can be categorized in delivering services to the user and being engineered in a smart way. For example, services being provided by IoT-Systems must fulfill users' goals in a highly dynamic and ad-hoc way. Consequently, this survey aims at answering various research questions regarding the methodical composition of system components and services. Furthermore, new research opportunities are sketched that should be tackled to make the scientific progress available to practitioners. Based on a systematic literature review from a software architecture point of view, in this paper we identify 75 primary studies for domain-specific IoT component composition approaches and architectures. Initial results show that current integration approaches mainly focus on performance evaluation of their integration solutions, which may be too narrow for fulfilling user goals by utilizing of IoT architectures.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85069944353"

If detected, DR can be treated to prevent further damage causing blindness. There is an increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to help detect DR using electronic health records. The lesion-related information documented in fundus image reports is a valuable resource that could help diagnoses of DR in clinical decision support systems. However, most studies for AI-based DR diagnoses are mainly based on medical images; there is limited studies to explore the lesion-related information captured in the free text image reports. Methods: In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art transformer-based natural language processing (NLP) models, including BERT and RoBERTa, compared them with a recurrent neural network implemented using Long short-term memory (LSTM) to extract DR-related concepts from clinical narratives. We identified four different categories of DR-related clinical concepts including lesions, eye parts, laterality, and severity, developed annotation guidelines, annotated a DR-corpus of 536 image reports, and developed transformer-based NLP models for clinical concept extraction and relation extraction. We also examined the relation extraction under two settings including ‘gold-standard’ setting—where gold-standard concepts were used–and end-to-end setting. Results: For concept extraction, the BERT model pretrained with the MIMIC III dataset achieve the best performance (0.9503 and 0.9645 for strict/lenient evaluation). For relation extraction, BERT model pretrained using general English text achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of 0.9316. The end-to-end system, BERT_general_e2e, achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of 0.8578 and 0.8881, respectively. Another end-to-end system based on the RoBERTa architecture, RoBERTa_general_e2e, also achieved the same performance as BERT_general_e2e in strict scores. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the efficiency of transformer-based NLP models for clinical concept extraction and relation extraction. Our results show that it’s necessary to pretrain transformer models using clinical text to optimize the performance for clinical concept extraction. Whereas, for relation extraction, transformers pretrained using general English text perform better. © 2022, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85138896942"

Material and methods: This review was based on the PRISMA guidelines and QUADAS 2 tool. A systematic search was performed of the literature on cases with endodontic treatments, comparing AI algorithms (test) versus conventional image assessments (control) for finding radiographic features. The search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and the Cochrane library. Inclusion criteria were studies on the use of AI and machine learning in endodontic treatments using dental X-rays. Results: The initial search retrieved 1131 papers, from which 24 were included. High heterogeneity of the materials left out a meta-analysis. The reported subcategories were periapical lesion, vertical root fractures, predicting root/canal morphology, locating minor apical foramen, tooth segmentation and endodontic retreatment prediction. Radiographic features assessed were mostly periapical lesions. The studies mostly considered the decision of 1–3 experts as the reference for training their models. Almost half of the included materials campared their trained neural network model with other methods. More than 58% of studies had some level of bias. Conclusions: AI-based models have shown effectiveness in finding radiographic features in different endodontic treatments. While the reported accuracy measurements seem promising, the papers mostly were biased methodologically. © 2023 The Author(s).

One of the main research lines in XAI is post-hoc explainability, the task of explaining the logic of an already deployed black-box model. This is usually achieved by learning an interpretable surrogate function that approximates the black box. Among the existing explanation paradigms, local linear explanations are one of the most popular due to their simplicity and fidelity. Despite their advantages, linear surrogates may not always be the most adapted method to produce reliable, i.e., unambiguous and faithful explanations. Hence, this paper introduces Adapted Post-hoc Explanations (APE), a novel method that characterizes the decision boundary of a black-box classifier and identifies when a linear model constitutes a reliable explanation. Besides, characterizing the black-box frontier allows us to provide complementary counterfactual explanations. Our experimental evaluation shows that APE identifies accurately the situations where linear surrogates are suitable while also providing meaningful counterfactual explanations. © 2022 ACM.","2-s2.0-85140909303"

This crucial step depends on the quality of the data analysis being done. The Space Weather community increased its use of AI in the past few years, but a thorough data analysis addressing all the potential issues is not always performed beforehand. Here is an analysis of a largely used dataset: Level-2 Advanced Composition Explorer’s SWEPAM and MAG measurements from 1998 to 2021 by the ACE Science Center. This work contains guidelines and highlights issues in the ACE data that are likely to be found in other space weather datasets: missing values, inconsistency in distributions, hidden information in statistics, etc. Amongst all specificities of this data, the following can seriously impact the use of algorithms: Histograms are not uniform distributions at all, but sometime Gaussian or Laplacian. Algorithms will be inconsistent in the learning samples as some rare cases will be underrepresented. Gaussian distributions could be overly brought by Gaussian noise from measurements and the signal-to-noise ratio is difficult to estimate. Models will not be reproducible from year to year due to high changes in histograms over time. This high dependence on the solar cycle suggests that one should have at least 11 consecutive years of data to train the algorithm. Rounding of ion temperatures values to different orders of magnitude throughout the data, (probably due to a fixed number of bits on which measurements are coded) will bias the model by wrongly over-representing or under-representing some values. There is an extensive number of missing values (e.g., 41.59% for ion density) that cannot be implemented without pre-processing. Each possible pre-processing is different and subjective depending on one’s underlying objectives A linear model will not be able to accurately model the data. Our linear analysis (e.g., PCA), struggles to explain the data and their relationships. However, non-linear relationships between data seem to exist. Data seem cyclic: we witness the apparition of the solar cycle and the synodic rotation period of the Sun when looking at autocorrelations. Some suggestions are given to address the issues described to enable usage of the dataset despite these challenges. Copyright © 2022 Bouriat, Vandame, Barthélémy and Chanussot.","2-s2.0-85143399068"

Apart from other services, contact tracing has been extensively performed with the help of Bluetooth and GPS-powered smartphone applications when vaccines were unavailable. In this article, we technically analyze the contact tracing platform developed by Google–Apple for constraining the spread of COVID-19. We suggest unexplored technical functionalities that can further strengthen the platform from privacy preservation, service scenarios, and robustness point of view. Lastly, some AI-based and privacy-assured services that can be integrated with the platform to control the pandemic adequately are suggested. The technical analysis demonstrates that while the Google–Apple platform is well-engineered, it is not free of vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and misconfigurations that may lead to its poor adoption in real-life scenarios.

Deep learning (DL) for medical decision support systems has particularly shown expert-level accuracy in predicting clinical outcomes. However, most of these machine learning and Artificial Intelligent (AI) models lack interpretability which causes major trust-related problems in healthcare. This necessitates the need for interpretable AI systems that can explain their decisions. This paper is designed to address the problem of how clinical decision support systems can be designed to be transparent, interpretable and therefore comprehensible for humans. In this view, this paper proposes an attentive hierarchical adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (AH-ANFIS), that combines fuzzy inference in a hierarchical architecture with attention for selecting the important rules. The proposed model benefits from the rule-based structure of ANFIS that enables the user to interpret the abstractions of hidden layers. The hierarchical structure in fuzzy modeling helps to overcome the rule explosion problem that arises with large medical data and improve interpretability. To ensure the improvement of interpretability with hierarchical architecture, an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is used to decompose the input space into an optimal permutation of input subsets which results in subsystems with independent meaning. The attention-based rule selector identifies the most activated rule to select important patient-specific features for predicting the clinical outcome. To verify the performance of the proposed AH-ANFIS and analyze the important features for classification, we perform experiments with two cancer diagnostic datasets. By pruning fuzzy if-then rules using recursive rule elimination (RRE), the complexity of the model is largely reduced while maintaining the performance of the system making it more interpretable. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85128737625"

Besides the XAI goal of making AI systems transparent, we address the semantic gap between user's perception and model ranking, which arises in content based image retrieval (CBIR). We attempt to explain the notion of similarity in images in a query-by-example scenario, starting with relatively simple features such as color, texture, objects, background-foreground segments, moving to semantic representations learned from hidden layers of deep networks. The base retrieval model compares the query vector with other image feature vectors to create rankings. This result list is transferred to a semantic feature space that allows rule-based re-rankings. The core contribution of this work is a re-ranking algorithm for generating explanations. Our re-ranking improves retrieval performance (MAP) when compared with a base ranker, a random baseline, and recent CBIR baseline rankers on PASCAL VOC data.

The use of audiovisual stimuli within immersive virtual reality environments is providing very intense emotional reactions, which provoke spontaneous physical and physiological changes that can be assimilated into real responses. In order to ensure high-quality recognition, the artificial intelligence (AI) system must be trained with adequate data sets, including not only those gathered by smart sensors but also the tags related to the elicited emotion. Currently, there are very few techniques available for the labeling of emotions. Among them, the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) devised by Lang is one of the most popular. This study shows experimentally that the graphic proposal for the original SAM labelling system, as devised by Lang, is not neutral to gender and contains gender biases in its design and representation. Therefore, a new graphic design has been proposed and tested according to the guidelines of expert judges. The results of the experiment show an overall improvement in the labeling of emotions in the pleasure–arousal–dominance (PAD) affective space, particularly, for women. This research proves the relevance of applying the gender perspective in the validation of tools used throughout the years.

The rapidly increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions highlights its potential to streamline physician work and optimize clinical decision-making, also in the field of pediatric radiology. Large imaging databases are necessary for training, validating and testing these algorithms. To better promote data accessibility in multi-institutional AI-enabled radiologic research, these databases centralize the large volumes of data required to effect accurate models and outcome predictions. However, such undertakings must consider the sensitivity of patient information and therefore utilize requisite data governance measures to safeguard data privacy and security, to recognize and mitigate the effects of bias and to promote ethical use. In this article we define data stewardship and data governance, review their key considerations and applicability to radiologic research in the pediatric context, and consider the associated best practices along with the ramifications of poorly executed data governance. We summarize several adaptable data governance frameworks and describe strategies for their implementation in the form of distributed and centralized approaches to data management. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85134543224"

However, being written by and for sociologists, GT is often challenging for a majority of SE researchers to understand and apply. Additionally, SE researchers attempting ad hoc adaptations of traditional GT guidelines for modern socio-technical (ST) contexts often struggle in the absence of clear and relevant guidelines to do so, resulting in poor quality studies. To overcome these research community challenges and leverage modern research opportunities, this paper presents Socio-Technical Grounded Theory (STGT) designed to ease application and achieve quality outcomes. It defines what exactly is meant by an ST research context and presents the STGT guidelines that expand GT's philosophical foundations, provide increased clarity and flexibility in its methodological steps and procedures, define possible scope and contexts of application, encourage frequent reporting of a variety of interim, preliminary, and mature outcomes, and introduce nuanced evaluation guidelines for different outcomes. It is hoped that the SE research community and related ST disciplines such as computer science, data science, artificial intelligence, information systems, human computer/robot/AI interaction, human-centered emerging technologies (and increasingly other disciplines being transformed by rapid digitalisation and AI-based augmentation), will benefit from applying STGT to conduct quality research studies and systematically produce rich findings and mature theories with confidence. © 1976-2012 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85113342741"

It has been criticized for what is measured, whether the predictions are more accurate than those made by humans, whether it creates or increases inequality and discrimination, and whether it compromises or violates other aspects of fairness. This criticism becomes even more topical with the arrival of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act. This article identifies and applies the relevant rules of the proposed AI Act in relation to quantitative recidivism risk assessment. It does so by focusing on the proposed rules for the quality of the data and the models used, on biases, and on the human oversight. It is concluded that legislation may consider requiring providers of high-risk AI systems to demonstrate that their solution performs significantly better than risk assessments based on simple models, and better than human assessment. Furthermore, there is no single answer to evaluate the performance of quantitative recidivism risk assessment tools that are or may be deployed in practice. Finally, three approaches of human oversight are discussed to correct for the negative effects of quantitative risk assessment: the optional, benchmark, and feedback approach. © 2022, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85136219994"

However, the safety impact of using AI in healthcare is largely unknown. In this paper we explore how different stakeholders (patients, hospital staff, technology developers, regulators) think about safety and safety assurance of healthcare AI. Methods: 26 interviews were undertaken with patients, hospital staff, technology developers and regulators to explore their perceptions on the safety and the safety assurance of AI in healthcare using the example of an AI-based infusion pump in the intensive care unit. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Participant perceptions related to: the potential impact of healthcare AI, requirements for human-AI interaction, safety assurance practices and regulatory frameworks for AI and the gaps that exist, and how incidents involving AI should be managed. Conclusion: The description of a diversity of views can support responsible innovation and adoption of such technologies in healthcare. Safety and assurance of healthcare AI need to be based on a systems approach that expands the current technology-centric focus. Lessons can be learned from the experiences with highly automated systems across safety-critical industries, but issues such as the impact of AI on the relationship between patients and their clinicians require greater consideration. Existing standards and best practices for the design and assurance of systems should be followed, but there is a need for greater awareness of these among technology developers. In addition, wider ethical, legal, and societal implications of the use of AI in healthcare need to be addressed. © 2022","2-s2.0-85133906098"

It is obvious that physical traffic police-based monitoring alone is insufficient to monitor such large traffic volumes and simultaneously track violations. This has led to many violators going unnoticed. The violators, in turn, cause more serious mishaps on the road resulting in danger to their own life as well as to other's life. Thus, there is a need for incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based techniques to eliminate manual intervention for the detection and catching of violators. In this paper, we propose a system to automatically detect two-wheeler violations like not wearing a helmet, usage of a phone while riding, triple riding, wheeling, and illegal parking for Indian road scenarios and eventually automating the ticketing process by capturing the violations and corresponding vehicle number in a database. We propose using a custom trained Yolo-v4 + DeepSORT for violation detection and tracking and Yolo-v4 + Tesseract for number plate detection and extraction. This implementation obtained a mean average precision (mAP) of 98.09% for violation detection and an accuracy of 99.41% for number plate detection on the test data. Further, the system detected 77 out of 93 violations with zero false positives in real-life scenarios. Thus,showing that the traffic violation system developed can be used to automate traffic violation ticketing. The developed system would be particularly useful in deriving various safety-related policies and will help to enforce strong regulation of traffic rules and build towards a smart city ecosystem via the automated AI-based traffic violation and ticketing system. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85134317512"

Traceability data flow associated with each lot of food products during any production and/or delivery phases can also be used to guarantee product authenticity. For this purpose, it is necessary to protect the data from cyber intrusions and, at the same time, to guarantee the integrity of the bond between the physical product and the data. Price grading related to quality perceivable or credence attributes attracts criminals to attempt item substitution fraud. Improved track and trace technologies supported by artificial intelligence (AI) could highly enhance systems’ capability to detect authenticity violations by product substitution. This paper proposes an innovative method based on AI, to reinforce traceability systems in detecting possible counterfeiting by product substitution. It is an item-based mass balance method that analyses the congruity of the traceability data flows not by using explicit (even stochastic) rules but by exploiting the learning capabilities of a neural network. The system can then detect sus-pect information in a traceability data flow, alerting a possible profit-driven crime.

Since this impact ultimately depends on political decisions about normative issues, political philosophers can make valuable contributions by addressing such questions. Currently, AI development and application are to a large extent regulated through non-binding ethics guidelines penned by transnational entities. Assuming that the global governance of AI should be at least minimally democratic and fair, this paper sets out three desiderata that an account should satisfy when theorizing about what this means. We argue, first, that an analysis of democratic values, political entities and decision-making should be done in a holistic way; second, that fairness is not only about how AI systems treat individuals, but also about how the benefits and burdens of transformative AI are distributed; and finally, that justice requires that governance mechanisms are not limited to AI technology, but are incorporated into a range of basic institutions. Thus, rather than offering a substantive theory of democratic and fair AI governance, our contribution is metatheoretical: we propose a theoretical framework that sets up certain normative boundary conditions for a satisfactory account. © 2022 Eva Erman and Markus Furendal, published by De Gruyter.","2-s2.0-85124127623"

During winter, expert pruners are employed to remove certain primary branches of dormant trees based on a set of predefined rules. The end goal of the automatic pruning applications is to reduce dependence on this huge labor and associated humongous costs by automating the pruning decisions, which in turn would facilitate easy interface with intelligent robotic pruners. In this chapter, we have developed a robust 3D reconstruction scheme that utilizes color information in addition to the time-of-flight depth data from Kinect2 sensor for accurately modeling the trunk and primary branches of a dormant apple tree. The motivation behind incorporating color in our framework is to acquire accurate 3D tree reconstruction even in absence of quality depth data. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons of our proposed approach with a depth based reconstruction technique depicts the usefulness of using color information in our automatic pruning system. On average, the proposed scheme provides a performance of 93.94% accuracy for correctly identifying the branches, and 71.13 and 89.26% for correctly estimating the diameters of the primary branches within error margins of 3 mm and 5 mm respectively. Moreover, the time complexity of our proposed algorithm shows an improvement in order of magnitude over the complexity of the baseline approach. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85141734135"

In this paper, we present a knowledge-based recommendation framework that exploits an explicit dataset of expert-validated meals to offer highly accurate diet plans spanning across ten user groups of both healthy subjects and participants with health conditions. The proposed advisor is built on a novel architecture that includes (a) a qualitative layer for verifying ingredient appropriateness, and (b) a quantitative layer for synthesizing meal plans. The first layer is implemented as an expert system for fuzzy inference relying on an ontology of rules acquired by experts in Nutrition, while the second layer as an optimization method for generating daily meal plans based on target nutrient values and ranges. The system’s effectiveness is evaluated through extensive experiments for establishing meal and meal plan appropriateness, meal variety, as well as system capacity for recommending meal plans. Evaluations involved synthetic data, including the generation of 3000 virtual user profiles and their weekly meal plans.

However, most of those AI systems lack transparency and interpretability due to the black-box nature of DL architecture, which causes major trust-related problems in AI applications where validation is essential. This necessitates the need for interpretable AI systems that can explain their decisions. In this view, this paper proposes a deep adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (Deep ANFIS), that combines fuzzy inference with DL architecture to provide a more comprehensible explanation of the decision processes. Deep ANFIS uses ANFIS based convolution units in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architecture that allows approximating the complex non-linear problems using fuzzy if-then rules. To verify the performance of the proposed Deep ANFIS and analyze the essential features for classification, we perform experiments with COGNIMUSE dataset for emotion recognition. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85145031644"

Consequently, automatic tools using artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor TAPP procedures and assess learning curves are required. The primary objective of this study was to establish a deep learning-based automated surgical phase recognition system for TAPP. A secondary objective was to investigate the relationship between surgical skills and phase duration. Methods: This study enrolled 119 patients who underwent the TAPP procedure. The surgical videos were annotated (delineated in time) and split into seven surgical phases (preparation, peritoneal flap incision, peritoneal flap dissection, hernia dissection, mesh deployment, mesh fixation, peritoneal flap closure, and additional closure). An AI model was trained to automatically recognize surgical phases from videos. The relationship between phase duration and surgical skills were also evaluated. Results: A fourfold cross-validation was used to assess the performance of the AI model. The accuracy was 88.81 and 85.82%, in unilateral and bilateral cases, respectively. In unilateral hernia cases, the duration of peritoneal incision (p = 0.003) and hernia dissection (p = 0.014) detected via AI were significantly shorter for experts than for trainees. Conclusion: An automated surgical phase recognition system was established for TAPP using deep learning with a high accuracy. Our AI-based system can be useful for the automatic monitoring of surgery progress, improving OR efficiency, evaluating surgical skills and video-based surgical education. Specific phase durations detected via the AI model were significantly associated with the surgeons’ learning curve. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85129750231"

Effective urban forestry management is essential for enhancing ES, but challenging to develop in densely populated cities where tradeoffs between high ES provision and issues of periodic disaster-caused risks or maintenance costs must be balanced. With the aim of providing practical guidelines to promote green cities, this study developed an AI-based analytical approach to systematically evaluate tree conditions and detect management problems. By using a self-organizing map technique with a big dataset of Taipei street trees, we integrated the ES values estimated by i-Tree Eco to tree attributes of DBH, height, leaf area, and leaf area index (LAI) to comprehensively assess their complex relationship and interlinkage. We found that DBH and leaf area are good indicators for the provision of ES, allowing us to quantify the potential loss and tradeoffs by cross-checking with tree height and the correspondent ES values. In contrast, LAI is less effective in estimating ES than DBH and leaf area, but is useful as a supplementary one. We developed a detailed lookup table by compiling the tree datasets to assist the practitioners with a rapid assessment of tree conditions and associated loss of ES values. This analytical approach provides accessible, science-based information to appraise the right species, criteria, and place for landscape design. It gives explicit references and guidelines to help detect problems and guide directions for improving the ES and the sustainability of urban forests.

Computational mammographic phenotypes have demonstrated a promising role in breast cancer risk prediction. With the recent exponential growth of computational efficiency, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, driven by the introduction of deep learning, has expanded the utility of imaging in predictive models. Consequently, AI-based imaging-derived data has led to some of the most promising tools for precision breast cancer screening. Main body: This review aims to synthesize the current state-of-the-art applications of AI in mammographic phenotyping of breast cancer risk. We discuss the fundamentals of AI and explore the computing advancements that have made AI-based image analysis essential in refining breast cancer risk assessment. Specifically, we discuss the use of data derived from digital mammography as well as digital breast tomosynthesis. Different aspects of breast cancer risk assessment are targeted including (a) robust and reproducible evaluations of breast density, a well-established breast cancer risk factor, (b) assessment of a woman’s inherent breast cancer risk, and (c) identification of women who are likely to be diagnosed with breast cancers after a negative or routine screen due to masking or the rapid and aggressive growth of a tumor. Lastly, we discuss AI challenges unique to the computational analysis of mammographic imaging as well as future directions for this promising research field. Conclusions: We provide a useful reference for AI researchers investigating image-based breast cancer risk assessment while indicating key priorities and challenges that, if properly addressed, could accelerate the implementation of AI-assisted risk stratification to future refine and individualize breast cancer screening strategies. © 2022, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85125006307"

Nowadays, the number of IoT devices is already higher than the world population. These devices operate by exchanging data between them, sometimes through an intermediate cloud infrastructure, and may be used to enable a wide variety of novel services that can potentially improve the quality of life of billions of people. Nonetheless, all that glitters is not gold: the increasing adoption of IoT comes with several privacy concerns due to the lack or loss of control over the sensitive data exchanged by these devices. This represents a key challenge for software engineering researchers attempting to address those privacy concerns by proposing (semi-)automated solutions to identify sources of privacy leaks. In this respect, a notable trend is represented by the adoption of smart solutions, that is, the definition of techniques based on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. This paper proposes a systematic literature review of the research in smart detection of privacy concerns in IoT devices. Following well-established guidelines, we identify 152 primary studies that we analyze under three main perspectives: (1) What are the privacy concerns addressed with AI-enabled techniques; (2) What are the algorithms employed and how they have been configured/validated; and (3) Which are the domains targeted by these techniques. The key results of the study identified six main tasks targeted through the use of artificial intelligence, like Malware Detection or Network Analysis. Support Vector Machine is the technique most frequently used in literature, however in many cases researchers do not explicitly indicate the domain where to use artificial intelligence algorithms. We conclude the paper by distilling several lessons learned and implications for software engineering researchers. © 2022","2-s2.0-85136467284"

The present study aimed to assess whether real-time artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted optical diagnosis is accurate enough to implement the leave-in-situ strategy for diminutive (≤ 5 mm) rectosigmoid polyps (DRSPs). Methods  Consecutive colonoscopy outpatients with ≥ 1 DRSP were included. DRSPs were categorized as adenomas or nonadenomas by the endoscopists, who had differing expertise in optical diagnosis, with the assistance of a real-time AI system (CAD-EYE). The primary end point was ≥ 90 % negative predictive value (NPV) for adenomatous histology in high confidence AI-assisted optical diagnosis of DRSPs (Preservation and Incorporation of Valuable endoscopic Innovations [PIVI-1] threshold), with histopathology as the reference standard. The agreement between optical- and histology-based post-polypectomy surveillance intervals (≥ 90 %; PIVI-2 threshold) was also calculated according to European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and United States Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) guidelines. Results  Overall 596 DRSPs were retrieved for histology in 389 patients; an AI-assisted high confidence optical diagnosis was made in 92.3 %. The NPV of AI-assisted optical diagnosis for DRSPs (PIVI-1) was 91.0 % (95 %CI 87.1 %-93.9 %). The PIVI-2 threshold was met with 97.4 % (95 %CI 95.7 %-98.9 %) and 92.6 % (95 %CI 90.0 %-95.2 %) of patients according to ESGE and USMSTF, respectively. AI-assisted optical diagnosis accuracy was significantly lower for nonexperts (82.3 %, 95 %CI 76.4 %-87.3 %) than for experts (91.9 %, 95 %CI 88.5 %-94.5 %); however, nonexperts quickly approached the performance levels of experts over time.

This creates new challenges for the HCI community when designing such systems. We reveal and investigate some of these challenges in a case study with an industry partner, and developed a prototype human-in-the-loop system for preference-guided 3D model processing. Two 3D artists used it in their daily work for 3 months. We found that the human-AI loop often did not converge towards a satisfactory result and designed a lab study (N=20) to investigate this further. We analyze interaction data and user feedback through the lens of theories of human judgment to explain the observed human-in-the-loop failures with two key insights: 1) optimization using preferential choices lacks mechanisms to deal with inconsistent and contradictory human judgments; 2) machine outcomes, in turn, influence future user inputs via heuristic biases and loss aversion. To mitigate these problems, we propose descriptive UI design guidelines. Our case study draws attention to challenging and practically relevant imperfections in human-AI loops that need to be considered when designing human-in-the-loop systems.  © 2022 ACM.","2-s2.0-85139174285"

A Swedish inquiry argued that existing criminal law rules on responsibility are not suitable for automated vehicles (when in the self-driving mode). The human in the driver’s seat would not be blamed if an accident occurs. Conversely, the Proposal for a Regulation on Artificial Intelligence places an emphasis on oversight by human beings to an extent. A battle for the hearts and minds of people might be underway here.

The tools and methodologies proposed by the supply-chain risk management (SCRM) literature are mostly based on experts’ judgments, their knowledge, and past data. The expert evaluation-based approach could be partly or fully replaced by AI solutions, increasing objectivity, impartiality, and impersonality, reducing sources of human mistakes, biases, and inefficiencies in SCRM. However, the transition from BA to AI in SCRM is not a self-contained process; though attractive as a vision, it is not straightforward as a management or implementation process. The purpose of this research is to explore and define the conceptual grounds for transitioning from BA to AI in SCRM. The conceptual SCRM structure, its AI suitability, and implementation terms are defined theoretically based on a literature review. A single, in-depth business case study is employed to explore the theoretically defined terms of AI-based SCRM implementation. The proposed conceptual AI-suitable SCRM structure is defined by five principal building blocks: risk events, risk-event indicators, data-processing rules and algorithms, analytical techniques, and risk event probability forecasts. The study concludes that the business environment meets AI-based SCRM-implementation terms of data existence and access. Since data on risk events and negative outcomes are limited for machine learning, experts’ experience and knowledge might be utilised to build initial rules and data-processing algorithms for AI. © 2022 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85140024666"

Considering the design and the four-phase development, only 10% of them complete the entire process, partly due to the increasing costs and complexity of clinical trials. This low completion rate has a huge negative impact in terms of population health, quality of care and health economics and sustainability. Automating some of the process' tasks with artificial intelligence (AI) tools could optimize some of the most burdensome ones, like patient selection, matching and enrollment; better patient selection could also reduce harmful treatment side effects. Although the pharmaceutical industry is embracing artificial AI tools, there is little evidence in the literature of their application in clinical trials. Methods: To address this issue, we performed a scoping review. Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we performed a search on PubMed for articles on the implementation of AI in the development of clinical trials. Results: The search yielded 772 articles, of which 15 were included. The articles were published between 2019 and 2022 and the results were presented descriptively. About half of the studies addressed the topic of patient recruitment; 12 articles reported specific examples of AI applications; five studies presented a quantitative estimate of the effectiveness of these tools. Conclusion: All studies present encouraging results on the implementation of AI-based applications to the development of clinical trials. AI-based applications have a lot of potential, but more studies are needed to validate these tools and facilitate their adoption.

Every informed measure must be taken to stop its spread, bring down number of new infections and move to normalization of daily life. Contemporary research has not identified waste management as one of the critical transmission vectors for COVID-19 virus. However, most underdeveloped countries are facing problems in waste management processes due to the general inadequacy and inability of waste management. In that context, smart intervention will be needed to contain possibility of the COVID-19 spread due to inadequate waste management. This paper presents a comparative study of the artificial intelligence/machine learning based techniques, and potential applications in the COVID-19 waste management cycle (WMC). A general integrated solid waste management (ISWM) strategy is mapped for both short-term and long-term goals of COVID-19 WMC, making use of the techniques investigated.

A total of 34 articles that met the selection criteria were critically analyzed based on QUADAS-2 guidelines. The certainty of the evidence of the included studies was assessed using the GRADE approach. AI has been widely applied for prediction of DC, for detection and diagnosis of DC and for classification of DC. These models have demonstrated excellent performance and can be used in clinical practice for enhancing the diagnostic performance, treatment quality and patient outcome and can also be applied to identify patients with a higher risk of developing DC. © 2022 by the authors.

Security experts manually define different types of rules and scripts based on CTI to perform validation tasks. These rules and scripts need to be updated continuously due to evolving threats, changing SOCs’ requirements and dynamic nature of CTI. The manual process of updating rules and scripts delays the response to attacks. To reduce the burden of human experts and accelerate response, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) based framework, SmartValidator. SmartValidator leverages Machine Learning (ML) techniques to enable automated validation of alerts. It consists of three layers to perform the tasks of data collection, model building and alert validation. It projects the validation task as a classification problem. Instead of building and saving models for all possible requirements, we propose to automatically construct the validation models based on SOC's requirements and CTI. We built a Proof of Concept (PoC) system with eight ML algorithms, two feature engineering techniques and 18 requirements to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of SmartValidator. The evaluation results showed that when prediction models were built automatically for classifying cyber threat data, the F1-score of 75% of the models were above 0.8, which indicates adequate performance of the PoC for use in a real-world organization. The results further showed that dynamic construction of prediction models required 99% less models to be built than pre-building models for all possible requirements. Thus, SmartValidator is much more efficient to use when SOCs’ requirements and threat behaviour are constantly evolving. The framework can be followed by various industries to accelerate and automate the validation of alerts and incidents based on their CTI and SOC's preferences. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85127644255"

Identifying and assessing these risk factors is the most significant phase in supply chain risk management (SCRM). The earlier risk quantification methods make timely decision-making more complex due to their inability to provide early warning. The paper aims to propose a model for analyzing the social media data to understand the potential SC risk factors in real-time. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the potential of text-mining, one of the most popular Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based data analytics approaches for extracting information from social media is exploited. The model retrieves the information using Twitter streaming API from online SC forums. Findings: The potential risk factors that disrupt SC performance are obtained from the recent data by text-mining analyses. The outcomes carry valuable insights about some contemporary SC issues due to the pandemic during the year 2021. The most frequent risk factors using rule mining techniques are also analyzed. Originality/value: This study presents the significant role of Twitter in real-time risk identification from online SC platforms like “Supply Chain Dive”, “Supply Chain Brain” and “Supply Chain Digest”.

Material and methods: The photographs of professional top models, representing several ancestries (non-Hispanic European and Euro–American, East Asian, Hispanic Euro–American, and African–American ancestries), were used to virtually modify skin tones (from light, medium to dark) and hair colour by an artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm. Hence, 117 modified photographs were then assessed by five local panels of about 60 women each (one in China, one in France and three in US). The same questionnaire was given to the panels, written in their own language, asking which and how both skin tones and hair colours fit preferentially (or not appreciated), asking in addition the reasons of their choices, using fixed wordings. Results: Answers from the five panels differed according to origin or cultural aspects, although some agreements were found among both non-Hispanic European and Euro-American groups. The Hispanic American panel in US globally much appreciated darker hair tones (HTs). Two panels (East Asian in China and African American in US) and part of non-Hispanic European panel in France declared appreciating all HTs, almost irrespective with the skin tone (light, medium and dark). This surprising result is very likely caused by gradings (in %) that differ by too low values, making the establishment of a decisive or significant assessment. By nature highly subjective (culturally and/or fashion driven), the assessments should be more viewed as trends, an unavoidable limit of the present virtual approach. The latter offers nevertheless a full respect of ethical rules as such objective could hardly be conducted in vivo: applying 10 or 11 hair colourations on the same individual is an unthinkable option. Conclusion: The virtual approach developed in the present study that mixes two major facial coloured phenotypes seems at the crossroad of both genetic backgrounds and the secular desire of a modified appearance. Nonetheless, this methodology could afford, at the individual level in total confidentiality, a great help to subjects exposed to some facial skin disorders or afflictions. © 2022 The Authors.

Artificial intelligence (AI) methods can detect MSI/dMMR directly in routine pathology slides, but the test performance has not been systematically investigated with predefined test thresholds. Method: We trained and validated AI-based MSI/dMMR detectors and evaluated predefined performance metrics using nine patient cohorts of 8343 patients across different countries and ethnicities. Results: Classifiers achieved clinical-grade performance, yielding an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of up to 0.96 without using any manual annotations. Subsequently, we show that the AI system can be applied as a rule-out test: by using cohort-specific thresholds, on average 52.73% of tumors in each surgical cohort [total number of MSI/dMMR = 1020, microsatellite stable (MSS)/ proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) = 7323 patients] could be identified as MSS/pMMR with a fixed sensitivity at 95%. In an additional cohort of N = 1530 (MSI/dMMR = 211, MSS/pMMR = 1319) endoscopy biopsy samples, the system achieved an AUROC of 0.89, and the cohort-specific threshold ruled out 44.12% of tumors with a fixed sensitivity at 95%. As a more robust alternative to cohort-specific thresholds, we showed that with a fixed threshold of 0.25 for all the cohorts, we can rule-out 25.51% in surgical specimens and 6.10% in biopsies. Interpretation: When applied in a clinical setting, this means that the AI system can rule out MSI/dMMR in a quarter (with global thresholds) or half of all CRC patients (with local fine-tuning), thereby reducing cost and turnaround time for molecular profiling. © 2022 The Author(s)","2-s2.0-85125539306"

Information systems can facilitate collaboration between humans and AI systems such that their individual capabilities complement each other. However, there is a lack of consolidated design guidelines for information systems facilitating the collaboration between humans and AI systems. This work examines how agent transparency affects trust and task outcomes in the context of human-AI collaboration. Drawing on the 3-Gap framework, we study agent transparency as a means to reduce the information asymmetry between humans and the AI. Following the Design Science Research paradigm, we formulate testable propositions, derive design requirements, and synthesize design principles. We instantiate two design principles as design features of an information system utilized in the hospitality industry. Further, we conduct two case studies to evaluate the effects of agent transparency: We find that trust increases when the AI system provides information on its reasoning, while trust decreases when the AI system provides information on sources of uncertainty. Additionally, we observe that agent transparency improves task outcomes as it enhances the accuracy of judgemental forecast adjustments. © 2022, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85130737893"

Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are particularly vulnerable, and their cybersecurity issues are receiving greater attention. However, existing research on cybersecurity has limited referencing value for HEI leaders and policy-makers because they are usually technology-focused. Publications that showcase best practices often lack system-wide perspectives towards cybersecurity in HEIs. Our paper, therefore, aims to bridge this literature gap and generate institutional cybersecurity strategies for HEI leaders and policy-makers from a system perspective. We first review how the cybersecurity landscape has evolved over the last few decades and its latest trends and projections for the next decade. By analysing these historical developments and new changes, we further illuminate the importance of strengthening HEI cybersecurity capacities. As we explore why HEIs face severe challenges to tackle the ever-escalating cyberattacks, we propose a system-wide approach to safeguard HEI cybersecurity and highlight the necessity to reassess prioritised areas. By taking an extensive literature review and desk research of methods that could respond to the cybersecurity vulnerabilities of the next decade, we synthesise our findings with a set of institutional strategies, with takeaways designed to equip HEIs better to address cybersecurity threats into the future. The strategies include: (1) Strengthening Institutional Governance for Cybersecurity; (2) Revisiting Cybersecurity KPIs; (3) Explicating Cybersecurity Policies, Guidelines and Mechanisms; (4) Training and Cybersecurity Awareness Campaigns to Build Cybersecurity Culture; (5) Responding to AI-based Cyber-threats and Harnessing AI to Enhance Cybersecurity; (6) Introduction of New and More Sophisticated Security Measures; (7) Paying Attention to Mobile Devices Use, Using Encryption as a Daily Practice; and (8) Risk Management. We believe that cybersecurity can be safeguarded throughout the new decade when these strategies are considered thoroughly and with the concerted effort of relevant HEI stakeholders. © 2022 by the authors.

All the operations are carried out by exchanging data among nodes. However, due to open communication nature of VDTN, the data broadcasted by mobile nodes are quiet susceptible to security attacks. Recently, a number of protocols are proposed for open communication. However, securing such communications and establishing trust value among vehicles are major addressable issues. This is because the existing fraudulent peers can lead to catastrophic circumstances on roads. Along with securing the data carriers, the authenticity and reliability of data is also equally important. In order to identify reliable nodes and maintaining the authenticity of data being communicated, a new artificial intelligence (AI)-based hybrid trust management framework is proposed in this article. The study particularly exploits the proximity-based k-nearest neighbour (kNN) classification model for selecting controlling nodes. Further, decision stump is employed to accomplish trust estimation rules, and backpropagation is used to self-train the mobile nodes, whenever anticipated trust value is not attained. The proposed scheme maintains the integrity of vehicular nodes and efficiently handles the specified. The trust framework uses a multifaceted direct and recommended trust estimation approach to calculate the global trust values.

The present work introduces a novel ensemble decision model which utilizes an explainable and fast-growing rule-based system, called extended belief rule base (EBRB) decision model, to alleviate the impact of class imbalance, where the proposed ensemble EBRB model includes two core components: a diversity-based base EBRB construction scheme and a consistency-based ensemble EBRB inference scheme. Specifically, for the purpose of enhancing diversity in the construction scheme, various kinds of oversampling techniques are applied to construct diverse base EBRBs firstly, followed by the calculation of attribute weights based on information gain. As for the inference scheme, the proposed ensemble EBRB model aims to produce inferential outputs not only integrating the rules activated from all base EBRBs, but also taking into consideration the consistency of the activated rules. In experimental study, twenty-six imbalanced classification datasets are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ensemble EBRB decision model. Results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms conventional EBRB systems and other typical imbalanced classifiers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85125239803"

However, technology is radically changing how public administration is organised and reliance on Artificial Intelligence is on the rise across all sectors. While carrying the promise of an increasingly efficient administration, automating (parts of) administrative decision-making processes also poses a challenge to our human-centred systems of control of public power. This article focuses on one of these control mechanisms: the duty to give reasons under EU law, a pillar of administrative law designed to enable individuals to challenge decisions and courts to exercise their powers of review. First, it analyses whether the duty to give reasons can be meaningfully applied when EU bodies rely on AI systems to inform their decision-making. Secondly, it examines the added value of secondary law, in particular the data protection rules applicable to EU institutions and the draft EU Artificial Intelligence Act, in complementing and adapting the duty to give reasons to better fulfil its purpose in a (partially) automated administration. This article concludes that the duty to give reasons provides a useful starting point but leaves a number of aspects unclear.

However, DL models are black-box methods hard to debug, interpret, and certify. DL alone cannot provide explanations that can be validated by a non technical audience such as end-users or domain experts. In contrast, symbolic AI systems that convert concepts into rules or symbols – such as knowledge graphs – are easier to explain. However, they present lower generalization and scaling capabilities. A very important challenge is to fuse DL representations with expert knowledge. One way to address this challenge, as well as the performance-explainability trade-off is by leveraging the best of both streams without obviating domain expert knowledge. In this paper, we tackle such problem by considering the symbolic knowledge is expressed in form of a domain expert knowledge graph. We present the eXplainable Neural-symbolic learning (X-NeSyL) methodology, designed to learn both symbolic and deep representations, together with an explainability metric to assess the level of alignment of machine and human expert explanations. The ultimate objective is to fuse DL representations with expert domain knowledge during the learning process so it serves as a sound basis for explainability. In particular, X-NeSyL methodology involves the concrete use of two notions of explanation, both at inference and training time respectively: (1) EXPLANet: Expert-aligned eXplainable Part-based cLAssifier NETwork Architecture, a compositional convolutional neural network that makes use of symbolic representations, and (2) SHAP-Backprop, an explainable AI-informed training procedure that corrects and guides the DL process to align with such symbolic representations in form of knowledge graphs. We showcase X-NeSyL methodology using MonuMAI dataset for monument facade image classification, and demonstrate that with our approach, it is possible to improve explainability at the same time as performance. © 2021 The Authors","2-s2.0-85117377421"

Current systems typically dictate that interaction between user input and AI output unfolds in discrete steps, as is the case with, for example, conversational agents. Novel scenarios require AI systems to adapt and respond to continuous user input, e.g., image-guided surgery and AI-supported text entry. In and across these applications, AI systems need to support more varied and dynamic interactions in which users and AI interact continuously and in parallel. Current methods and guidelines are often inadequate and sometimes even detrimental to user needs when considering continuous usage scenarios. Realizing a continuous interaction between users and AI requires a substantial change in perspective when designing Human-AI systems.

Methods and results: We studied 100 consecutive patients (57 ± 15 years old, 61% male), including 38 with abnormal left ventricular (LV) function [LV ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50%]. The autoEF results acquired using the HUD were independently compared with manually traced biplane Simpson's rule measurements on cart-based systems to assess method agreement using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), linear regression analysis, and Bland-Altman analysis. The diagnostic accuracy for the detection of LVEF <50% was also calculated. Test-retest reliability of measured EF by the HUD was assessed by calculating the ICC and the minimal detectable change (MDC). The ICC, linear regression analysis, and Bland-Altman analysis revealed good agreement between autoEF and reference manual EF (ICC = 0.85; r = 0.87, P < 0.001; mean bias-1.42% with limits of agreement 14.5%, respectively). Detection of abnormal LV function (EF < 50%) by autoEF algorithm was feasible with sensitivity 90% (95% CI 75-97%), specificity 87% (95% CI 76-94%), PPV 81% (95% CI 66-91%), NPV 93% (95% CI 83-98%), and a total diagnostic accuracy of 88%.

Particularly, machine learning (ML) systems cause reason for concern due to their opaque and self-learning characteristics. Nevertheless, what such accountability mechanisms should look like remains either largely unspecified (e.g., ‘stakeholder input’) or ineffective (e.g., ‘ethical guidelines’). In this paper, I argue that the difficulty to formulate and develop effective accountability mechanisms lies partly in the predominant focus on Mill's harm's principle, rooted in the conception of freedom as non-interference. A strong focus on harm overcasts other moral wrongs, such as potentially problematic power dynamics between those who shape the system and those affected by it. I propose that the neo-republican conception of freedom as non-domination provides a suitable framework to inform responsible ML development. Domination, understood by neo-republicans, is a moral wrong as it undermines the potential for human flourishing. In order to mitigate domination, neo-republicans plead for accountability mechanisms that minimize arbitrary relations of power. Neo-republicanism should hence inform responsible ML development as it provides substantive and concrete grounds when accountability mechanisms are effective (i.e. when they are non-dominating). © 2021","2-s2.0-85125265404"

Despite its popularity, little is known about the roles and effects of algorithmic literacy (AL) on user acceptance. The purpose of this study is to contextualize AL in the AI environment by empirically examining the role of AL in developing users' information processing in algorithms. The authors analyze how users engage with over-the-top (OTT) platforms, what awareness the user has of the algorithmic platform and how awareness of AL may impact their interaction with these systems. Design/methodology/approach: This study employed multiple-group equivalence methods to compare two group invariance and the hypotheses concerning differences in the effects of AL. The method examined how AL helps users to envisage, understand and work with algorithms, depending on their understanding of the control of the information flow embedded within them. Findings: Our findings clarify what functions AL plays in the adoption of OTT platforms and how users experience algorithms, particularly in contexts where AI is used in OTT algorithms to provide personalized recommendations. The results point to the heuristic functions of AL in connection with its ties in trust and ensuing attitude and behavior. Heuristic processes using AL strongly affect the credibility of recommendations and the way users understand the accuracy and personalization of results. The authors argue that critical assessment of AL must be understood not just about how it is used to evaluate the trust of service, but also regarding how it is performatively related in the modeling of algorithmic personalization. Research limitations/implications: The relation of AL and trust in an algorithm lends strategic direction in developing user-centered algorithms in OTT contexts. As the AI industry has faced decreasing credibility, the role of user trust will surely give insights on credibility and trust in algorithms. To better understand how to cultivate a sense of literacy regarding algorithm consumption, the AI industry could provide examples of what positive engagement with algorithm platforms looks like. Originality/value: User cognitive processes of AL provide conceptual frameworks for algorithm services and a practical guideline for the design of OTT services. Framing the cognitive process of AL in reference to trust has made relevant contributions to the ongoing debate surrounding algorithms and literacy. While the topic of AL is widely recognized, empirical evidence on the effects of AL is relatively rare, particularly from the user's behavioral perspective. No formal theoretical model of algorithmic decision-making based on the dual processing model has been researched. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2-s2.0-85116214825"

When it comes to Explainable AI (XAI), understanding who interacts with the black-box of AI is just as important as ""opening""it, if not more. Yet the discourse of XAI has been predominantly centered around the black-box, suffering from deficiencies in meeting user needs and exacerbating issues of algorithmic opacity. To address these issues, researchers have called for human-centered approaches to XAI. In this second CHI workshop on Human-centered XAI (HCXAI), we build on the success of the first installment from CHI 2021 to expand the conversation around XAI. We chart the domain and shape the HCXAI discourse with reflective discussions from diverse stakeholders. The goal of the second installment is to go beyond the black box and examine how human-centered perspectives in XAI can be operationalized at the conceptual, methodological, and technical levels. Encouraging holistic (historical, sociological, and technical) approaches, we put an emphasis on ""operationalizing"", aiming to produce actionable frameworks, transferable evaluation methods, concrete design guidelines, and articulate a coordinated research agenda for XAI. © 2022 Owner/Author.","2-s2.0-85129739238"

The obvious opportunities in terms of accuracy, speed and originality of research are accompanied by questions about the possible risks and the consequent responsibilities involved in such a disruptive technology. In recent years, this twofold aspect has led to an increase in analyses of the ethical and political implications of AI. As a result, there has been a proliferation of documents that seek to define the strategic objectives of AI together with the ethical precautions required for its acceptable development and deployment. Although the number of documents is certainly significant, doubts remain as to whether they can effectively play a role in safeguarding democratic decision-making processes. Indeed, a common feature of the national strategies and ethical guidelines published in recent years is that they only timidly address how to integrate civil society into the selection of AI objectives. Although scholars are increasingly advocating the necessity to include civil society, it remains unclear which modalities should be selected. If both national strategies and ethics guidelines appear to be neglecting the necessary role of a democratic scrutiny for identifying challenges, objectives, strategies and the appropriate regulatory measures that such a disruptive technology should undergo, the question is then, what measures can we advocate that are able to overcome such limitations? Considering the necessity to operate holistically with AI as a social object, what theoretical framework can we adopt in order to implement a model of governance? What conceptual methodology shall we develop that is able to offer fruitful insights to governance of AI? Drawing on the insights of classical pragmatist scholars, we propose a framework of democratic experimentation based on the method of social inquiry. In this article, we first summarize some of the main points of discussion around the potential societal, ethical and political issues of AI systems. We then identify the main answers and solutions by analyzing current national strategies and ethics guidelines. After showing the theoretical and practical limits of these approaches, we outline an alternative proposal that can help strengthening the active role of society in the discussion about the role and extent of AI systems.

AI introduces new ways of doing jobs and business, and of exploring new global market opportuni-ties. However, on the other hand, it provides many challenges to comprehend. Therefore, our study’s main objective was to examine the behavioral, cultural, ethical, social, and economic challenges of AI-enabled products and services in consumer markets and discuss how businesses might shape their approaches to address AI-related ethical issues. AI offers numerous social, ethical, and behavioral difficulties for people, organizations, and societies that endanger the sustainable development of economies. These fundamental challenges due to AI technologies have raised serious questions for the sustainable development of electronic markets. Based on this, the current study presents a framework highlighting these issues. Systematic reviewing was our research method; we looked for explicit information and methods that indicate the credibility of research or reduce biases. This paper is of great importance, as it highlights several behavioral, societal, ethical, and cultural aspects in electronic markets which were not presented in previous studies. Some key issues are the security and privacy of consumers, AI biases, individual autonomy, wellbeing, and issues of unemployment. Therefore, companies that use AI systems need to be socially responsible and make AI systems as secure as possible to promote the sustainable development of countries. The results suggest that AI has undoubtedly transformed life and has both positive and negative effects. However, the main aim regarding AI should be to use it for the overall goals of humanity. Moreover, authorities operating in e-business environments need to create proper rules and regulations and make the systems as secure as possible for people. © 2022 by the authors.

We propose a membrane lifetime estimation method via functional machine learning (FML) using 12 biological-chemical-physical functional parameters and a predictive maintenance system for membrane replacement based on AI-driven functional profile monitoring (FPM). Biological, chemical, and physical information regarding membrane aging were reflected in the 12 functional parameters extracted from transmembrane pressure (TMP) and the chemical dosage. Membrane aging was diagnosed using hidden patterns and trends in the functional parameters, then the membrane lifetime was estimated by interpreting their relationships using FML. Influential functional parameters regarding membrane lifetime were monitored using FPM, and membrane replacement time was suggested according to newly suggested 4 types of membrane replacement rule. The predictive maintenance system improved the performance of permeability, pumping energy, and NaOCl cost by 0.66%, 0.45%, and 3.55%, respectively while extending membrane lifetime by 18 days. The proposed predictive maintenance system was considered efficient in comparison with manual maintenance and an incompetent maintenance system. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85125451559"

Traditionally, dentistry has lagged behind general medicine in the integration of new technologies: So what is the status quo of precision dentistry? The primary focus of this review is to provide a current overview of personalized workflows in the discipline of reconstructive dentistry (prosthodontics) and to highlight the disruptive potential of novel technologies for dentistry; the possible impact on society is also critically discussed. Material and methods: Narrative literature review. Results: Narrative literature review. Conclusions: In the near future, artificial intelligence (AI) will increase diagnostic accuracy, simplify treatment planning, and thus contribute to the development of personalized reconstructive workflows by analyzing e-health data to promote decision-making on an individual patient basis. Dental education will also benefit from AI systems for personalized curricula considering the individual students’ skills. Augmented reality (AR) will facilitate communication with patients and improve clinical workflows through the use of visually guided protocols. Tele-dentistry will enable opportunities for remote contact among dental professionals and facilitate remote patient consultations and post-treatment follow-up using digital devices. Finally, a personalized digital dental passport encoded using blockchain technology could enable prosthetic rehabilitation using 3D-printed dental biomaterials. Clinical significance: Overall, AI can be seen as the door-opener and driving force for the evolution from evidence-based prosthodontics to personalized reconstructive dentistry encompassing a synoptic approach with prosthetic and implant workflows. Nevertheless, ethical concerns need to be solved and international guidelines for data management and computing power must be established prior to a widespread routine implementation. © 2022, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85127331325"

Results: A search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science between 2007 and 2021 yielded 9327 articles, of which 29 were selected. Significant heterogeneity was noted between studies. Reanalysis had an overall diagnostic yield of 0.10 (95% CI = 0.06-0.13). Literature updates accounted for most new diagnoses. Diagnostic yield was higher after 24 months, although this was not statistically significant. Increased diagnoses were obtained with research validation and data sharing. AI-based tools did not adversely affect reanalysis diagnostic rate. Conclusion: Next generation sequencing data reanalysis can improve diagnostic yield. Owing to the heterogeneity of the studies, the optimal time to reanalysis and the impact of AI-based tools could not be determined with confidence.

Due to the lack of clear evidence-based medical guidelines for the number of embryos to be transferred in RIF patients, how to obtain the highest single cycle pregnancy success rate with as few embryos transferred as possible while avoiding multiple pregnancy as much as possible, that is, how to balance the pregnancy success rate and multiple pregnancy rate, is a great challenge for clinicians and RIF patients. We urgently need an effective and reliable assisted decision-making method to help clinicians find this balance, and an artificial intelligence (AI) system will provide an efficient solution. Design and Methods: In this research, we filtered out the RIF data set (n = 45,921) from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) database from 2005 to 2016. The data set was divided into two groups according to the number of embryos transferred, Group A and B. Group A included 34,175 cycles with two embryos transferred, while Group B included 11,746 cycles with only one embryo transferred, each containing 44 features and a prediction label (pregnancy). Four machine learning algorithms (RF, GBDT, AdaBoost, and MLP) were used to train Group A and Group B data set respectively and 10-folder cross validation method was used to validate the models. Results: The results revealed that the AdaBoost model of Group A obtained the best performance, while the GBDT model in Group B was proved to be the best model. Both models had been proved to provide accurate prediction of transfer outcome. Conclusion: Our research provided a new approach for targeted and personalized treatment of RIF patients to help them achieve efficient and reliable pregnancy. And an AI-assisted decision-making system will be designed to help clinicians and RIF patients develop personalized transfer strategies, which not only guarantees efficient and reliable pregnancy, but also avoids the risk of multiple pregnancy as much as possible.

This paper tries first to facilitate the different stakeholder perspectives in this field and then to partly address the apparent gap between the academic research community and the requirements imposed onto forensic practitioners. The intention is to facilitate the mutual understanding of these two classes of stakeholders and assist with first steps intended at closing this gap. To do so, first a concept for modelling media forensic investigation pipelines is derived from established guidelines. Then, the applicability of such modelling is illustrated on the example of a fusion-based media forensic investigation pipeline aimed at the detection of DeepFake videos using five exemplary detectors (hand-crafted, in one case neural network supported) and testing two different fusion operators.

This paper aims to investigate VA-enabled interactions between hotels and guests in the hospitality context. The research positions VAs within the artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) context, disrupting old practices and processes. Smart hospitality uses VAs to support effortless value cocreation for guests cost-effectively. The research examines consumer perceptions and expectations of hospitality VAs and explores VA capabilities through expert technology providers. Design/methodology/approach: This empirical paper investigates the current use and future implications of VAs for hotel environments. It uses qualitative, semi-structured in-depth interviews with 7 expert hospitality VA technology providers and 21 hotel guests who have VA experience. The research adopts a demand and supply approach, addressing the VAs in hospitality holistically. Findings: The findings illustrate the requirements from both end-users’ sides, hotels and guests, exploring VA advantages and challenges. The analysis demonstrates that VAs increasingly become digital assistants. VA technology helps hotels to improve customer service, expand operational capability and reduce costs. Although in its infancy, VA technology has made progress towards optimising hotel operations and upgrading customer service. The study proposes a speech-enabled interactions model. Research limitations/implications: This research stimulates the transformation of hospitality services by using VAs and the development of smart hospitality and tourism ecosystems. The study can benefit from further research with hotel managers, to reflect hoteliers’ points of view and investigate their perception of VAs. Further research can also explore different aspects of consumer–VA interaction in different contexts. Practical implications: The paper makes a significant contribution to hospitality management and human–computer interaction best practices. It supports technology providers to reconsider how to develop suitable technology solutions towards improving their strategic competitiveness. It also explains how to use VAs cost-effectively and profitably while adding value to travellers’ experience. Originality/value: VA studies are often focussed on the technology in private households, rather than in commercial or hotel spaces.

Subset selections powered by AI-based methods include top-k analytics, data summarization, clustering, and multi-winner voting. While group fairness auditing tools have been proposed for classification systems, these state-of-The-Art tools are not directly applicable to measuring and conceptualizing fairness in selected subsets. In this work, we introduce the first comprehensive auditing framework, FINS, to support stakeholders in interpretably quantifying group fairness across a diverse range of subset-specific fairness concerns. FINS offers a family of novel measures that provide a flexible means to audit group fairness for fairness goals ranging from item-based, score-based, and a combination thereof. FINS provides one unified easy-To-understand interpretation across these different fairness problems. Further, we develop guidelines through the FINS Fair Subset Chart, that supports auditors in determining which measures are relevant to their problem context and fairness objectives. We provide a comprehensive mapping between each fairness measure and the belief system (i.e., worldview) that is encoded within its measurement of fairness. Lastly, we demonstrate the interpretability and efficacy of FINS in supporting the identification of real bias with case studies using AirBnB listings and voter records.  © 2022 ACM.","2-s2.0-85137161090"

Smart manufacturing emphasizes a fully automated data-driven decision-making; however, the AI incubation process involves human experts to enhance AI systems by integrating domain knowledge for modeling, data collection and annotation, and feature extraction. Such an AI incubation process not only enhances the domain knowledge discovery but also improves the interpretability and trustworthiness of AI methods. In this article, we focus on the knowledge transfer from human experts to a supervised learning problem by learning domain knowledge as interpretable features and rules, which can be used to construct rule-based systems to support manufacturing decision making, such as process modeling and quality inspection. Although many advanced statistical and machine learning methods have shown promising modeling accuracy and efficiency, rule-based systems are still highly preferred and widely adopted due to their interpretability for human experts to comprehend. However, most of the existing rule-based systems are constructed based on deterministic human-crafted rules, whose parameters, such as thresholds of decision rules, are suboptimal. Yet the machine learning methods, such as tree models or neural networks, can learn a decision rule based structure without much interpretation or agreement with domain knowledge. Therefore, the traditional machine learning models and human experts' domain knowledge cannot be directly improved by learning from data. In this research, we propose an interpretable neural network (INN) model with a center-adjustable sigmoid activation function to efficiently optimize the rule-based systems. Using the rule-based system from domain knowledge to regulate the INN architecture not only improves the prediction accuracy with optimized parameters but also ensures the interpretability by adopting the interpretable rule-based systems from domain knowledge. The proposed INN will be effective for supervised learning problems when rule-based systems are available. The merits of the INN model are demonstrated via a simulation study and a real case study in the quality modeling of a semiconductor manufacturing process. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.","2-s2.0-85147941195"

To learn the underlying reasons and understand user needs for bridging this gap, we conducted a retrospective analysis with 8 UX professionals to understand their practice and identify opportunities for future research. We found that the current AI-enabled systems to support UX work mainly work on graphical interface elements, while design activities that involve more ""design thinking""such as user interviews and user testings are more helpful for designers. Many current systems were also designed for overly-simplistic and generic use scenarios.

Conventional identification of EGFR or PD-L1 status requires surgical or biopsied tumor specimens, which are obtained through invasive procedures associated with risk of morbidities and may be unavailable to access tissue samples. Here, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can predict EGFR and PD-L1 status in using non-invasive computed tomography (CT) images. Methods: A multitask AI system including deep learning (DL) module, radiomics (RA) module, and joint (JO) module combining the DL, RA, and clinical features was developed, trained, and optimized with CT images to predict the EGFR and PD-L1 status. We used feature selectors and feature fusion methods to find the best model among combinations of module types. The models were evaluated using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs). Results: Our multitask AI system yielded promising performance for gene expression status, subtype classification, and joint prediction. The AUCs of DL module achieved 0.842 (95% CI, 0.825–0.855) in the EGFR mutated status and 0.805 (95% CI, 0.779–0.829) in the mutated-EGFR subtypes discrimination (19Del, L858R, other mutations). DL module also demonstrated the AUCs of 0.799 (95% CI, 0.762–0.854) in the PD-L1 expression status and 0.837 (95% CI, 0.775–0.911) in the positive-PD-L1 subtypes (PD-L1 tumor proportion score, 1%–49% and ≥50%). Furthermore, the JO module of our AI system performed well in the EGFR and PD-L1 joint cohort, with an AUC of 0.928 (95% CI, 0.909–0.946) for distinguishing EGFR mutated status and 0.905 (95% CI, 0.886–0.930) for discriminating PD-L1 expression status. Conclusion: Our AI system has demonstrated the encouraging results for identifying gene status and further assessing the genotypes. Both clinical indicators and radiomics features showed a complementary role in prediction and provided accurate estimates to predict EGFR and PD-L1 status. Furthermore, this non-invasive, high-throughput, and interpretable AI system can be used as an assistive tool in conjunction with or in lieu of ancillary tests and extensive diagnostic workups to facilitate early intervention.

Hypokinetic and ataxic dysarthria are common in movement disorders and represent the underlying neuropathology. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model to distinguish ataxic dysarthria and hypokinetic dysarthria from normal speech and differentiate ataxic and hypokinetic speech in parkinsonian diseases and cerebellar ataxia. We screened 804 perceptual speech analyses performed in the Samsung Medical Center Neurology Department between January 2017 and December 2020. The data of patients diagnosed with parkinsonian disorders or cerebellar ataxia were included. Two speech tasks (numbering from 1 to 50 and reading nine sentences) were analyzed. We adopted convolutional neural networks and developed a patch-wise wave splitting and integrating AI system for audio classification (PWSI-AI-AC) to differentiate between ataxic and hypokinetic speech. Of the 395 speech recordings for the reading task, 76, 112, and 207 were from normal, ataxic dysarthria, and hypokinetic dysarthria subjects, respectively. Of the 409 recordings of the numbering task, 82, 111, and 216 were from normal, ataxic dysarthria, and hypokinetic dysarthria subjects, respectively. The reading and numbering task recordings were classified with 5-fold cross-validation using PWSI-AI-AC as follows: hypokinetic dysarthria vs. others (area under the curve: 0.92 ± 0.01 and 0.92 ± 0.02), ataxia vs. others (0.93 ± 0.04 and 0.89 ± 0.02), hypokinetic dysarthria vs. ataxia (0.96 ± 0.02 and 0.95 ± 0.01), hypokinetic dysarthria vs. none (0.86 ± 0.03 and 0.87 ± 0.05), and ataxia vs. none (0.87 ± 0.07 and 0.87 ± 0.09), respectively. PWSI-AI-AC showed reliable performance in differentiating ataxic and hypokinetic dysarthria and effectively augmented data to classify the types even with limited training samples. The proposed fully automatic AI system outperforms neurology residents. Our model can provide effective guidelines for screening related diseases and differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Copyright: © 2022 Song et al.

Objective: This paper documents the search strategy and process for a scoping review exploring how age-related bias is encoded or amplified in AI systems as well as the corresponding legal and ethical implications. Methods: The scoping review follows a 6-stage methodology framework developed by Arksey and O’Malley. The search strategy has been established in 6 databases. We will investigate the legal implications of ageism in AI by searching grey literature databases, targeted websites, and popular search engines and using an iterative search strategy. Studies meet the inclusion criteria if they are in English, peer-reviewed, available electronically in full text, and meet one of the following two additional criteria: (1) include “bias” related to AI in any application (eg, facial recognition) and (2) discuss bias related to the concept of old age or ageism. At least two reviewers will independently conduct the title, abstract, and full-text screening. Search results will be reported using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) reporting guideline. We will chart data on a structured form and conduct a thematic analysis to highlight the societal, legal, and ethical implications reported in the literature. Results: The database searches resulted in 7595 records when the searches were piloted in November 2021. The scoping review will be completed by December 2022. Conclusions: The findings will provide interdisciplinary insights into the extent of age-related bias in AI systems. The results will contribute foundational knowledge that can encourage multisectoral cooperation to ensure that AI is developed and deployed in a manner consistent with ethical values and human rights legislation as it relates to an older and aging population.

Many of the commonly known rules or used explanations for such a stock-picking process are too vague to be applied in concrete cases, and at the same time, it is challenging to analyze high-dimensional data with a low number of cases in order to derive data-driven and usable explanations. This work proposes an explainable AI (XAI) approach on the quarterly available fundamental data of companies traded on the German stock market. In the XAI, distance-based structures in data (DSD) that guide decision tree induction are identified. The leaves of the appropriately selected decision tree contain subsets of stocks and provide viable explanations that can be rated by a human. The prediction of the future price trends of specific stocks is made possible using the explanations and a rating. In each quarter, stock picking by DSD-XAI is based on understanding the explanations and has a higher success rate than arbitrary stock picking, a hybrid AI system, and a recent unsupervised decision tree called eUD3.5. © 2022 by the author.

In this experience, we propose a predictive model able to quantify the dosimetric impact due to daily inter-fraction variability in a standard RT breast treatment, to identify in advance the treatment fractions where patients might benefit from an online ART approach. Methods: The study was focused on right breast cancer patients treated using standard adjuvant RT on an artificial intelligence (AI)-based linear accelerator. Patients were treated with daily CBCT images and without online adaptation, prescribing 40.05 Gy in 15 fractions, with four IMRT tangential beams. ESTRO guidelines were followed for the delineation on planning CT (pCT) of organs at risk and targets. For each patient, all the CBCT images were rigidly aligned to pCT: CTV and PTV were manually re-contoured and the original treatment plan was recalculated. Various radiological parameters were measured on CBCT images, to quantify inter-fraction variability present in each RT fraction after the couch shifts compensation. The variation of these parameters was correlated with the variation of V95% of PTV (ΔV95%) using the Wilcoxon Mann–Whitney test. Fractions where ΔV95% > 2% were considered as adverse events. A logistic regression model was calculated considering the most significant parameter, and its performance was quantified with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: A total of 75 fractions on 5 patients were analyzed. The body variation between daily CBCT and pCT along the beam axis with the highest MU was identified as the best predictor (p = 0.002). The predictive model showed an area under ROC curve of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82–0.99) with a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 83.8% at the best threshold, which was equal to 3 mm. Conclusion: A novel strategy to identify treatment fractions that may benefit online ART was proposed.

We hypothesize that when a system makes a deduction that was, in some way, unexpected by the user then locating the source of the disagreement or misunderstanding is best achieved through a collaborative dialogue process that allows the participants to gradually isolate the cause.

A fundamental aspect of humane working conditions is the ability to exert influence over different aspects of one's own work. Consequently, stakeholders contribute to the prospect of maintaining the workers' autonomy albeit increasing automation and summarize this aspiration with the human in control principle. Job control has been part of multiple theories and models within the field of occupational psychology. However, most of the models do not include specific technical considerations nor focus on task but rather on job level. That is, they are possibly not able to fully explain specific changes regarding the digitalization of tasks. According to the results of a large-scale study on German workers (DiWaBe), this seems to be the case to some extend: the influence of varying degrees of automation, moderated by perceived autonomy, on workers' wellbeing was not consistent. However, automation is a double-edged sword: on a high level, it can be reversely related to the workers' job control while highly autonomous and reliable systems can also create opportunities for more flexible, impactful and diverse working tasks. Consequently, automation can foster and decrease the factor of job control. Models about the optimal level of automation aim to give guidelines on how the former can be achieved. The results of the DiWaBe study indicate that automation in occupational practice does not always happen in line with these models. Instead, a substantial part of automation happens at the decision-making level, while executive actions remain with the human. From an occupational safety and health perspective, it is therefore crucial to closely monitor and anticipate the implementation of AI in working systems. Constellations where employees are too controlled by technology and are left with a high degree of demands and very limited resources should be avoided. Instead, it would be favorable to use AI as an assistance tool for the employees, helping them to gather and process information and assisting them in decision-making.

Beside traditional credit data, the creation of consumers’ credit-scores now involves also non-traditional data and is based on the predictions that lenders can make on the basis of those data. The use of AI, coupled with the availability of extensive amounts of ‘alternative’ data, poses several questions as to the level of protection granted to consumers in relation to the discriminatory effects that an ungoverned used of such technology can generate. The article addresses the suitability of the Proposal for a new Directive on Consumer Credit to protect consumers that enter into credit agreements where access to credit is determined by AI-based credit scoring systems. In doing so, it also takes into consideration other rules within the EU legal framework that can provide, albeit indirectly, protection to consumers, such as antidiscrimination law and Article 22 of the GDPR. It concludes that in a technologically complicated scenario such as the one of AI credit scoring, consumers can be effectively protected only by introducing an ecosystem of rules that while empowering consumers also regulates the use of AI on the business side of the credit agreement. © 2022.

One hundred twenty-two patients who underwent dual-source CT were retrospectively included. Ninety-three of these patients had been administered intravenous iodinated contrast. Images were evaluated using the prototypical algorithm, which segments the TA and determines the corresponding diameters at predefined anatomical locations based on the American Heart Association guidelines. The reference standard was established by two radiologists individually in a blinded, randomized fashion. Equivalency was tested and inter-reader agreement was assessed using intra-class correlation (ICC). In total, 99.2% of the parameters measured by the prototype were assessable. In nine patients, the prototype failed to determine one diameter along the vessel. Measurements along the TA did not differ between the algorithm and readers (p > 0.05), establishing equivalence. Inter-reader agreement between the algorithm and readers (ICC ≥ 0.961; 95% CI: 0.940–0.974), and between the readers was excellent (ICC ≥ 0.879; 95% CI: 0.818–0.92). The evaluated prototypical AI-based algorithm accurately measured TA diameters at each region of interest independent of the use of either contrast utilization or pathology. This indicates that the prototypical algorithm has substantial potential as a valuable tool in the rapid clinical evaluation of aortic pathology. © 2022 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85137394930"

The clinical neuroradiologist is thus confronted with the increasing dilemma to base clinical decisions on the output of AI tools without knowing in detail what is happening inside the “black box” of those AI applications. This dilemma is aggravated by the fact that currently, no established and generally accepted rules exist concerning best clinical practice and scientific and clinical validation nor for the medico-legal consequences in cases of wrong diagnoses. The current review article provides a practical checklist of essential points, intended to aid the user to identify and double-check necessary aspects, although we are aware that not all this information may be readily available at this stage, even for certified and commercially available AI tools.

For the processing of geomatics data, AI offers overwhelming opportunities. Fundamental questions include how AI can be specifically applied to or must be specifically created for geomatics data. This change is also having a significant impact on geospatial data. The integration of AI approaches in geomatics has developed into the concept of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), which is a new paradigm for geographic knowledge discovery and beyond. However, little systematic work currently exists on how researchers have applied AI for geospatial domains. Hence, this contribution outlines AI-based techniques for analysing and interpreting complex geomatics data. Our analysis has covered several gaps, for instance defining relationships between AI-based approaches and geomatics data. First, technologies and tools used for data acquisition are outlined, with a particular focus on red-green-blue (RGB) images, thermal images, 3D point clouds, trajectories, and hyperspectral-multispectral images. Then, how AI approaches have been exploited for the interpretation of geomatic data is explained. Finally, a broad set of examples of applications is given, together with the specific method applied. Limitations point towards unexplored areas for future investigations, serving as useful guidelines for future research directions. © Copyright: ","2-s2.0-85132047224"

Integrating thermal energy storage (TES) into building energy systems is desirable for improving energy flexibility and cost efficiency. However, an optimal control strategy for TES system operation is required to maximize its advantages of balancing energy supply and demand. This study proposed a model predictive control (MPC) scheme using artificial intelligence (AI) to control the TES system and validated it by the experimental analysis. To construct a reliable and computationally manageable MPC controller, an artificial neural network was utilized as a prediction model, and a metaheuristic algorithm of εDE-RJ was employed as an optimization solver. The AI-based MPC for cooling operation was examined using a reduced-scale experimental system consisting of a chiller, sensible TES tank, heat exchangers, and variable-speed pumps. AI-based MPC optimized the charging and discharging rates of the TES system to minimize the operating cost. Three cooling load profiles were tested for both MPC and rule-based control methods. The results showed that AI-based MPC was highly feasible by flexibly managing the different load levels and reducing the operating cost by 9.1–14.6%. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85123825189"

This study aims to automatically analyze the critical risk clauses in the invitation to bid (ITB) at the bidding stage to strengthen their competitiveness for the EPC contractors. To this end, we developed an automated analysis technology that effectively analyzes a large amount of ITB documents in a short time by applying natural language processing (NLP) and bi-directional long short-term memory (bi-LSTM) algorithms. This study proposes two models. First, the semantic analysis (SA) model is a rule-based approach that applies NLP to extract key risk clauses. Second, the risk level ranking (RLR) model is a train-based approach that ranks the risk impact for each clause by applying bi-LSTM. After developing and training an artificial intelligent (AI)-based ITB analysis model, its performance was evaluated through the actual project data. As a result of validation, the SA model showed an F1 score of 86.4 percent, and the RLR model showed an accuracy of 46.8 percent. The RLR model displayed relatively low performance because the ITB used in the evaluation test included the contract clauses that did not exist in the training dataset. Therefore, this study illustrated that the rule-based approach performed superior to the training-based method. The authors suggest that EPC contractors should apply both the SA and RLR modes in the ITB analysis, as one supplements the other. The two models were embedded in the Engineering Machine-learning Automation Platform (EMAP), a cloud-based platform developed by the authors. Rapid analysis through applying both the rule-based and AI-based automatic ITB analysis technology can contribute to securing timeliness for risk response and supplement possible human mistakes in the bidding stage. © 2022 by the authors.

This study will assess the feasibility and impact of integrating an artificial intelligence (AI)-based ASD diagnosis aid (the device) into the existing ECHO Autism Screening Tool for Autism in Toddlers and Young Children (STAT) diagnosis model. The prescription-only Software as a Medical Device, designed for use in children aged 18 to 72 months at risk for developmental delay, produces ASD diagnostic recommendations after analyzing behavioral features from 3 distinct inputs: a caregiver questionnaire, 2 short home videos analyzed by trained video analysts, and a health care provider questionnaire. The device is not a stand-alone diagnostic and should be used in conjunction with clinical judgment. Objective: This study aims to assess the feasibility and impact of integrating an AI-based ASD diagnosis aid into the ECHO Autism STAT diagnosis model. The time from initial ECHO Autism clinician concern to ASD diagnosis is the primary end point. Secondary end points include the time from initial caregiver concern to ASD diagnosis, time from diagnosis to treatment initiation, and clinician and caregiver experience of device use as part of the ASD diagnostic journey. Methods: Research participants for this prospective observational study will be patients suspected of having ASD (aged 18-72 months) and their caregivers and up to 15 trained ECHO Autism clinicians recruited by the ECHO Autism Communities research team from across rural and suburban areas of the United States. Clinicians will provide routine clinical care and conduct best practice ECHO Autism diagnostic evaluations in addition to prescribing the device. Outcome data will be collected via a combination of electronic questionnaires, reviews of standard clinical care records, and analysis of device outputs. The expected study duration is no more than 12 months. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Missouri-Columbia (institutional review board-assigned project number 2075722). Results: Participant recruitment began in April 2022. As of June 2022, a total of 41 participants have been enrolled. Conclusions: This prospective observational study will be the first to evaluate the use of a novel AI-based ASD diagnosis aid as part of a real-world primary care diagnostic pathway. If device integration into primary care proves feasible and efficacious, prolonged delays between the first ASD concern and eventual diagnosis may be reduced. Streamlining primary care ASD diagnosis could potentially reduce the strain on specialty services and allow a greater proportion of children to commence early intervention during a critical neurodevelopmental window. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

Without a clear understanding of audit practices, let alone widely used standards or regulatory guidance, claims that an AI product or system has been audited, whether by first-, second-, or third-party auditors, are difficult to verify and may potentially exacerbate, rather than mitigate, bias and harm. To address this knowledge gap, we provide the first comprehensive field scan of the AI audit ecosystem. We share a catalog of individuals (N=438) and organizations (N=189) who engage in algorithmic audits or whose work is directly relevant to algorithmic audits; conduct an anonymous survey of the group (N=152); and interview industry leaders (N=10). We identify emerging best practices as well as methods and tools that are becoming commonplace, and enumerate common barriers to leveraging algorithmic audits as effective accountability mechanisms. We outline policy recommendations to improve the quality and impact of these audits, and highlight proposals with wide support from algorithmic auditors as well as areas of debate. Our recommendations have implications for lawmakers, regulators, internal company policymakers, and standards-setting bodies, as well as for auditors. They are: 1) require the owners and operators of AI systems to engage in independent algorithmic audits against clearly defined standards; 2) notify individuals when they are subject to algorithmic decision-making systems; 3) mandate disclosure of key components of audit findings for peer review; 4) consider real-world harm in the audit process, including through standardized harm incident reporting and response mechanisms; 5) directly involve the stakeholders most likely to be harmed by AI systems in the algorithmic audit process; and 6) formalize evaluation and, potentially, accreditation of algorithmic auditors. © 2022 ACM.","2-s2.0-85133022250"

Early-stage clinical evaluation is important to assess an AI system’s actual clinical performance at small scale, ensure its safety, evaluate the human factors surrounding its use and pave the way to further large-scale trials. However, the reporting of these early studies remains inadequate. The present statement provides a multi-stakeholder, consensus-based reporting guideline for the Developmental and Exploratory Clinical Investigations of DEcision support systems driven by Artificial Intelligence (DECIDE-AI). We conducted a two-round, modified Delphi process to collect and analyze expert opinion on the reporting of early clinical evaluation of AI systems. Experts were recruited from 20 pre-defined stakeholder categories. The final composition and wording of the guideline was determined at a virtual consensus meeting. The checklist and the Explanation & Elaboration (E&E) sections were refined based on feedback from a qualitative evaluation process. In total, 123 experts participated in the first round of Delphi, 138 in the second round, 16 in the consensus meeting and 16 in the qualitative evaluation. The DECIDE-AI reporting guideline comprises 17 AI-specific reporting items (made of 28 subitems) and ten generic reporting items, with an E&E paragraph provided for each. Through consultation and consensus with a range of stakeholders, we developed a guideline comprising key items that should be reported in early-stage clinical studies of AI-based decision support systems in healthcare. By providing an actionable checklist of minimal reporting items, the DECIDE-AI guideline will facilitate the appraisal of these studies and replicability of their findings. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","2-s2.0-85130297162"

A systematic review of the different applications of AI-based software on all aspects of a cataract patient's management, from diagnosis to follow-up, was carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. All selected articles were analyzed to assess the level of evidence according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 2011 guidelines, and the quality of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. Of the articles analyzed, 49 met the inclusion criteria. No data synthesis was possible for the heterogeneity of available data and the design of the available studies. The AI-driven diagnosis seemed to be comparable and, in selected cases, to even exceed the accuracy of experienced clinicians in classifying disease, supporting the operating room scheduling, and intraoperative and postoperative management of complications. Considering the heterogeneity of data analyzed, however, further randomized controlled trials to assess the efficacy and safety of AI application in the management of cataract should be highly warranted. © 2021","2-s2.0-85117498973"

Patients with CLL can undergo transformation to a more aggressive lymphoma, most often diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), known as Richter transformation (RT). An accelerated phase of CLL (aCLL) also may be observed which correlates with subsequent transformation to DLBCL, and may represent an early stage of transformation. Distinguishing PCs in CLL from aCLL or RT can be diagnostically challenging, particularly in small needle biopsy specimens. Available guidelines pertaining to distinguishing CLL from its’ progressive forms are limited, subject to the morphologist’s experience and are often not completely helpful in the assessment of scant biopsy specimens. To objectively assess the extent of PCs in aCLL and RT, and enhance diagnostic accuracy, we sought to design an artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool to identify and delineate PCs based on feature analysis of the combined individual nuclear size and intensity, designated here as the heat value. Using the mean heat value from the generated heat value image of all cases, we were able to reliably separate CLL, aCLL and RT with sensitive diagnostic predictive values. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.","2-s2.0-85124354875"

We describe a general framework for considering the readiness of AI for PV, followed by some examples of the application of AI to ICSR processing and evaluation in industry and FDA. We conclude that AI can usefully be applied to some aspects of ICSR processing and evaluation, but the performance of current AI algorithms requires a ‘human-in-the-loop’ to ensure good quality. We identify outstanding scientific and policy issues to be addressed before the full potential of AI can be exploited for ICSR processing and evaluation, including approaches to quality assurance of ‘human-in-the-loop’ AI systems, large-scale, publicly available training datasets, a well-defined and computable ‘cognitive framework’, a formal sociotechnical framework for applying AI to PV, and development of best practices for applying AI to PV. Practical experience with stepwise implementation of AI for ICSR processing and evaluation will likely provide important lessons that will inform the necessary policy and regulatory framework to facilitate widespread adoption and provide a foundation for further development of AI approaches to other aspects of PV. © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","2-s2.0-85130101961"

Recently, data-driven predictions have attracted interest in high-stakes decision-making. Despite this, advanced AI methods are less often used for such tasks. This is because AI technology is a black box for the social systems it is meant to support; trustworthiness and fairness have not yet been established. Meanwhile in the field of marketing, strategic decision-making is a high-stakes problem that has a significant impact on business trends. For global marketing, with its diverse cultures and market environments, future decision-making is likely to focus on building consensus on the formulation of the problem itself rather than on solutions for achieving the goal. There are two important and conflicting facts: the fact that the core of domestic strategic decision-making comes down to the formulation of the problem itself, and the fact that it is difficult to realize AI technology that can achieve problem formulation. How can we resolve this difficulty with current technology? This is the main challenge for the realization of high-level human-AI systems in the marketing field. Thus, we propose customer journey mapping (CJM) automation through model-level data fusion, a process for the practical problem formulation known as explainable alignment. Using domain-specific requirements and observations as inputs, the system automatically outputs a CJM. Explainable alignment corresponds with both human and AI perspectives and in formulating the problem, thereby improving strategic decision-making in marketing. Following preprocessing to make latent variables and their dynamics transparent with latent Dirichlet allocation and a variational autoencoder, a post-hoc explanation is implemented in which a hidden Markov model and learning from an interpretation transition are combined with a long short-term memory architecture that learns sequential data between touchpoints for extracting attitude rules for CJM. Finally, we realize the application of human-AI systems to strategic decision-making in marketing with actual logs in over-the-top media services, in which the dynamic behavior of customers for CJM can be automatically extracted.

Increasingly, the applications of AI are no longer limited to search and recommendation systems, such as web search and movie and product recommendations, but AI is also being used in decisions and processes that are critical for individuals, businesses, and society. With AI based solutions in high-stakes domains such as hiring, lending, criminal justice, healthcare, and education, the resulting personal and professional implications of AI are far-reaching. Consequently, it becomes critical to ensure that these models are making accurate predictions, are robust to shifts in the data, are not relying on spurious features, and are not unduly discriminating against minority groups. To this end, several approaches spanning various areas such as explainability, fairness, and robustness have been proposed in recent literature, and many papers and tutorials on these topics have been presented in recent computer science conferences. However, there is relatively less attention on the need for monitoring machine learning (ML) models once they are deployed and the associated research challenges. In this tutorial, we first motivate the need for ML model monitoring[14], as part of a broader AI model governance[9] and responsible AI framework, from societal, legal, customer/end-user, and model developer perspectives, and provide a roadmap for thinking about model monitoring in practice. We then present findings and insights on model monitoring desiderata based on interviews with various ML practitioners spanning domains such as financial services, healthcare, hiring, online retail, computational advertising, and conversational assistants[15]. We then describe the technical considerations and challenges associated with realizing the above desiderata in practice. We provide an overview of techniques/tools for model monitoring (e.g., see [1, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 10-13, 18-21]. Then, we focus on the real-world application of model monitoring methods and tools [3, 4, 7, 11, 13, 16, 17], present practical challenges/guidelines for using such techniques effectively, and lessons learned from deploying model monitoring tools for several web-scale AI/ML applications. We present case studies across different companies, spanning application domains such as financial services, healthcare, hiring, conversational assistants, online retail, computational advertising, search and recommendation systems, and fraud detection. We hope that our tutorial will inform both researchers and practitioners, stimulate further research on model monitoring, and pave the way for building more reliable ML models and monitoring tools in the future.  © 2022 Owner/Author.","2-s2.0-85137144890"

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to overcome this limitation by assisting in complex task analysis. To date, AI use for PPE protocols has not been studied. In this paper we validate the performance of an AI PPE system in a hospital setting. Methods: A clinical cohort study of 74 healthcare workers (HCW) at a 144-bed University teaching hospital. Participants were recruited to use the AI system for PPE donning and doffing. Performance was validated by the current gold standard double-buddy system across seven donning and ten doffing steps based on local infection control guidelines. Results: The AI-PPE platform was 98.9% sensitive on doffing and 85.3% sensitive on donning, when compared to remediated double buddy. On average, buddy correction of PPE was required 3.8 ± 1.5% of the time. The average time taken to don was 240 ± 51.5 seconds and doff was 241 ± 35.3 seconds. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the ability of an AI model to analyse PPE donning and doffing with real-time feedback for remediation. The AI platform can identify complex multi-task PPE donning and doffing in a single validated system. This AI system can be employed to train, audit, and thereby improve compliance whilst reducing reliance on limited HCW resources.

This leads to a lack of trust in AI systems. To solve this, the field of explainable AI has been working on ways to produce explanations of these systems’ behaviors. Many methods in explainable AI, such as LIME (Ribeiro et al. in Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2016), offer only a statistical argument for the validity of their explanations. However, some methods instead study the internal structure of the system and try to find components which can be assigned an interpretation. I believe that these methods provide more valuable explanations than those statistical in nature. I will try to identify which explanations can be considered internal to the system using the Chomskyan notion of tacit knowledge. I argue that each explanation expresses a rule, and through the localization of this rule in the system internals, we can take a system to have tacit knowledge of the rule. I conclude that the only methods which are able to sufficiently establish this tacit knowledge are those along the lines of Olah (Distill 2(11): 4901–4911, 2017), and therefore they provide explanations with unique strengths. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","2-s2.0-85122866928"

To train an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system in cane pruning, the attributes of grapevine dormant shoots were characterised. Methods and Results: Eight attributes of dormant shoots, diameter, length, vertical and horizontal distance, node number, internode length, origin and position relative to bottom fruiting wire, were measured prior to and after pruning. Vine canopies were modified according to a 5 [total node numbers on canes: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50] × 3 [total node numbers on spurs: 1, 2, 3] factorial design. Compared to non-retained dormant shoots, retained dormant shoots were thicker (9.2 ± 0.07 mm), longer (104.7 ± 0.93 cm), close to the vine trunk (11.4 ± 0.65 cm) and below the bottom fruiting wire (83.2 ± 0.54 cm). Spurs had the shortest horizontal (9.8 ± 0.93 cm) and vertical (77.8 ± 0.7 cm) distance, originating from the vine head, base nodes and first nodes of old canes and old spurs. Modifying the vine canopy via increased node numbers had a significant effect on all retained dormant shoot attributes (P < 0.05) except on the position relative to the bottom fruiting wire. Conclusions: Cane pruning in commercial vineyards is consistent and follows rules based on viticulture knowledge. Retained, non-retained dormant shoots, canes and spurs exhibit distinct attributes useful in quantifying, assessing and modelling cane pruning.

It reduces the life expectancy of patients by 15 years. Abnormal behavior, perception of emotions, social relationships, and reality perception are among its most significant symptoms. Past studies have revealed that SZ affects the temporal and anterior lobes of hippocampus regions of the brain. Also, increased volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and decreased volume of white and gray matter can be observed due to this disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the popular neuroimaging technique used to explore structural/functional brain abnormalities in SZ disorder, owing to its high spatial resolution. Various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been employed with advanced image/signal processing methods to accurately diagnose SZ. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of studies conducted on the automated diagnosis of SZ using MRI modalities. First, an AI-based computer aided-diagnosis system (CADS) for SZ diagnosis and its relevant sections are presented. Then, this section introduces the most important conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques in the diagnosis of diagnosing SZ. A comprehensive comparison is also made between ML and DL studies in the discussion section. In the following, the most important challenges in diagnosing SZ are addressed.

Researching the relevant documents begins with writing the panorama or the state of knowledge on the topic. This article is about the IT infrastructure based on the requirements for an architecture and behavior that a versatile, agile company needs to accompany the constantly changing framework conditions of the market. The technology used and the available resources, including the human resources, need to be adapted as early as possible. Data now represent the most valuable asset on Earth and future industrial manufacturing systems must maximize the opportunity of data usage. Low-level data must be transformed to make them useful in supporting intelligent decision-making, for example. Furthermore, future manufacturing systems must be highly productive, adaptable, absent of error, and kind to the environment and to local communities. The all-important design should minimize the waste of material, capital, energy, and media. Herein, we discuss the fulfilling of agile customer requirements involving adaptable and modulated production processes (related to the ‘agile manufacturing’ and ‘digital transformation’ perspectives). © 2022 by the authors.

Given the diversity of the techniques, we believe it would be helpful to assess them using a broad conceptual framework within which the different approaches reside. Towards that goal, we categorize the different methods into symbolic AI, purely data-driven numeric AI, and hybrid AI methods. Symbolic AI-based approaches require the translation of a priori chemistry knowledge into clearly encoded rules and instructions. Purely data-driven numeric AI methods utilize recent advances in machine learning, generally without explicit incorporation of a priori domain knowledge. In between these two extremes, we have hybrid AI, which integrates domain knowledge with data-driven techniques. We review recent progress across these broad areas to highlight their benefits as well as limitations and provide a future outlook of this rapidly evolving field. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85117360122"

The most common approach is to use AI systems to adapt to unanticipated threats and improve system performance. However, most studies aim to improve performance, and performance-oriented systems tend to be composed of black box models, whose internal working is complex. In the field of security control, analysts strive for interpretation and response based on information from given data, system prediction results, and knowledge. Consequently, performance-oriented systems suffer from a lack of interpretability owing to the lack of system prediction results and internal process information. The recent social climate also demands a responsible system rather than a performance-focused one. This research aims to ensure understanding and interpretation by providing interpretability for AI systems in multiple classification environments that can detect various attacks. In particular, the better the performance, the more complex and less transparent the model and the more limited the area that the analyst can understand, the lower the processing efficiency accordingly. The approach provided in this research is an intrusion detection methodology that uses FOS based on SHAP values to evaluate if the prediction result is suspicious and selects the optimal rule from the transparent model to improve the explanation. © 2022 by the authors.

Artificial intelligence (AI)-based image analysis has the potential to automate this postoperative surveillance. the aim of this study was to prepare a scoping review to investigate how AI is being used in the analysis of radiographs following THA and tKA, and how accurate these tools are. Methods The Embase, MEDLINE, and PubMed libraries were systematically searched to identify relevant articles. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews and Arksey and o’Malley framework were followed. study quality was assessed using a modified Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies tool. AI performance was reported using either the area under the curve (AUC) or accuracy. Results Of the 455 studies identified, only 12 were suitable for inclusion. Nine reported implant identification and three described predicting risk of implant failure. Of the 12, three studies compared AI performance with orthopaedic surgeons. AI-based implant identification achieved AUC 0.992 to 1, and most algorithms reported an accuracy > 90%, using 550 to 320,000 training radiographs. AI prediction of dislocation risk post-THA, determined after five-year follow-up, was satisfactory (AUC 76.67; 8,500 training radiographs). Diagnosis of hip implant loosening was good (accuracy 88.3%; 420 training radiographs) and measurement of postoperative acetabular angles was comparable to humans (mean absolute difference 1.35° to 1.39°). However, 11 of the 12 studies had several methodological limitations introducing a high risk of bias. None of the studies were externally validated. Conclusion These studies show that AI is promising. While it already has the ability to analyze images with significant precision, there is currently insufficient high-level evidence to support its widespread clinical use. Further research to design robust studies that follow standard reporting guidelines should be encouraged to develop AI models that could be easily translated into real-world conditions. © 2022 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.","2-s2.0-85135219021"

Although its applications in various branches of medicine, such as pediatric oncology, are many and promising, its use is still in an embryonic stage. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the state of the art regarding the AI application in pediatric oncology, through a systematic review of systematic reviews, and to analyze current trends in Europe, through a bibliometric analysis of publications written by European authors. Among 330 records found, 25 were included in the systematic review. All papers have been published since 2017, demonstrating only recent attention to this field. The total number of studies included in the selected reviews was 674, with a third including an author with a European affiliation. In bibliometric analysis, 304 out of the 978 records found were included. Similarly, the number of publications began to dramatically increase from 2017. Most explored AI applications regard the use of diagnostic images, particularly radiomics, as well as the group of neoplasms most involved are the central nervous system tumors. No evidence was found regarding the use of AI for process mining, clinical pathway modeling, or computer interpreted guidelines to improve the healthcare process. No robust evidence is yet available in any of the domains investigated by systematic reviews. However, the scientific production in Europe is significant and consistent with the topics covered in systematic reviews at the global level. The use of AI in pediatric oncology is developing rapidly with promising results, but numerous gaps and challenges persist to validate its utilization in clinical practice. An important limitation is the need for large datasets for training algorithms, calling for international collaborative studies.

With few exceptions, they interpret Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics narrowly in a liberal political framework of privacy concerns, transparency, governance and non-discrimination. One of the main hurdles to establishing “ethical AI” remains how to operationalize high-level principles such that they translate to technology design, development and use in the labor process. This is because organizations can end up interpreting ethics in an ad-hoc way with no oversight, treating ethics as simply another technological problem with technological solutions, and regulations have been largely detached from the issues AI presents for workers. There is a distinct lack of supra-national standards for fair, decent, or just AI in contexts where people depend on and work in tandem with it. Topics such as discrimination and bias in job allocation, surveillance and control in the labor process, and quantification of work have received significant attention, yet questions around AI and job quality and working conditions have not. This has left workers exposed to potential risks and harms of AI. In this paper, we provide a critique of relevant academic literature and policies related to AI ethics. We then identify a set of principles that could facilitate fairer working conditions with AI. As part of a broader research initiative with the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, we propose a set of accountability mechanisms to ensure AI systems foster fairer working conditions. Such processes are aimed at reshaping the social impact of technology from the point of inception to set a research agenda for the future. As such, the key contribution of the paper is how to bridge from abstract ethical principles to operationalizable processes in the vast field of AI and new technology at work.

However, few or no attempts have been made to propose a reproducible CAD development workflow for 3D MRI data. In this paper, we present the development of an easily reproducible and reliable CAD tool using the Clinica and MONAI frameworks that were developed to introduce standardized practices in medical imaging. A Deep Learning (DL) algorithm was trained to detect frontotemporal dementia (FTD) on data from the NIFD database to ensure reproducibility. The DL model yielded 0.80 accuracy (95% confidence intervals: 0.64, 0.91), 1 sensitivity, 0.6 specificity, 0.83 F1-score, and 0.86 AUC, achieving a comparable performance with other FTD classification approaches. Explainable AI methods were applied to understand AI behavior and to identify regions of the images where the DL model misbehaves. Attention maps highlighted that its decision was driven by hallmarking brain areas for FTD and helped us to understand how to improve FTD detection. The proposed standardized methodology could be useful for benchmark comparison in FTD classification. AI-based CAD tools should be developed with the goal of standardizing pipelines, as varying pre-processing and training methods, along with the absence of model behavior explanations, negatively impact regulators’ attitudes towards CAD. The adoption of common best practices for neuroimaging data analysis is a step toward fast evaluation of efficacy and safety of CAD and may accelerate the adoption of AI products in the healthcare system. © 2022 by the authors.

With a large proportion of patients referred to Hospital Eye Services (HES) for diagnostics and disease management, the referral process results in unnecessary referrals from erroneous diagnoses and delays in access to appropriate treatment. A potential solution is a teleophthalmology digital referral pathway linking community optometry and HES. Methods and analysis The HERMES study (Teleophthalmology-enabled and artificial intelligence-ready referral pathway for community optometry referrals of retinal disease: a cluster randomised superiority trial with a linked diagnostic accuracy study) is a cluster randomised clinical trial for evaluating the effectiveness of a teleophthalmology referral pathway between community optometry and HES for retinal diseases. Nested within HERMES is a diagnostic accuracy study, which assesses the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI) decision support system (DSS) for automated diagnosis and referral recommendation. A postimplementation, observational substudy, a within-trial economic evaluation and discrete choice experiment will assess the feasibility of implementation of both digital technologies within a real-life setting. Patients with a suspicion of retinal disease, undergoing eye examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, will be recruited across 24 optometry practices in the UK. Optometry practices will be randomised to standard care or teleophthalmology. The primary outcome is the proportion of false-positive referrals (unnecessary HES visits) in the current referral pathway compared with the teleophthalmology referral pathway. OCT scans will be interpreted by the AI DSS, which provides a diagnosis and referral decision and the primary outcome for the AI diagnostic study is diagnostic accuracy of the referral decision made by the Moorfields-DeepMind AI system. Secondary outcomes relate to inappropriate referral rate, cost-effectiveness analyses and human-computer interaction (HCI) analyses. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from the London - Bromley Research Ethics Committee (REC 20/LO/1299). Findings will be reported through academic journals in ophthalmology, health services research and HCI. Trial registration number ISRCTN18106677 (protocol V.1.1). © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group.

The decision, therefore, remains personal and lends itself well to help from a clinical decision support system, specifically one guided by artificial intelligence (AI). QRhythm utilizes a 2-stage machine learning (ML) model to identify the optimal rhythm management strategy in a given patient based on a set of clinical factors, in which the model first uses supervised learning to predict the actions of an expert clinician and identifies the best strategy through reinforcement learning to obtain the best clinical outcome-a composite of symptomatic recurrence, hospitalization, and stroke. Objective: We qualitatively evaluated a novel, AI-based, clinical decision support system (CDSS) for AF rhythm management, called QRhythm, which uses both supervised and reinforcement learning to recommend either a rate control or one of 3 types of rhythm control strategies-external cardioversion, antiarrhythmic medication, or ablation-based on individual patient characteristics. Methods: Thirty-three clinicians, including cardiology attendings and fellows and internal medicine attendings and residents, performed an assessment of QRhythm, followed by a survey to assess relative comfort with automated CDSS in rhythm management and to examine areas for future development. Results: The 33 providers were surveyed with training levels ranging from resident to fellow to attending. Of the characteristics of the app surveyed, safety was most important to providers, with an average importance rating of 4.7 out of 5 (SD 0.72). This priority was followed by clinical integrity (a desire for the advice provided to make clinical sense; importance rating 4.5, SD 0.9), backward interpretability (transparency in the population used to create the algorithm; importance rating 4.3, SD 0.65), transparency of the algorithm (reasoning underlying the decisions made; importance rating 4.3, SD 0.88), and provider autonomy (the ability to challenge the decisions made by the model; importance rating 3.85, SD 0.83). Providers who used the app ranked the integrity of recommendations as their highest concern with ongoing clinical use of the model, followed by efficacy of the application and patient data security. Trust in the app varied; 1 (17%) provider responded that they somewhat disagreed with the statement, “I trust the recommendations provided by the QRhythm app,” 2 (33%) providers responded with neutrality to the statement, and 3 (50%) somewhat agreed with the statement. Conclusions: Safety of ML applications was the highest priority of the providers surveyed, and trust of such models remains varied. Widespread clinical acceptance of ML in health care is dependent on how much providers trust the algorithms. Building this trust involves ensuring transparency and interpretability of the model. ©John Stacy, Rachel Kim, Christopher Barrett, Balaviknesh Sekar, Steven Simon, Farnoush Banaei-Kashani, Michael A Rosenberg.

Due to the complexity and diversity of trees and sites, collecting and verifying relevant personal experiences takes tree assessors many years. In many countries, new tree assessors learn from a small number of experienced peers. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to collect and condense scattered knowledge and deploy it in a support tool for basic tree assessment. In this project, the application of a commercial AI decision-making system software (Dylogos) to tree assessment is tested. The software is based on a new dynamic nonclassical logic, which combines diverse knowledge sources to an emergent system to support visual tree assessments. A set of rules describes existing knowledge about the mostly unsharp parameters affecting the likelihood of failure and damage. The software evaluates the data collected during a basic tree assessment and provides an estimate of the level of risk posed by the tree. The result and the reasons for it are presented in plain language. Users can then examine this estimate and feed their own assessment back into the system to train it further, so that this “white” AI system is self-learning based on experience acquired in practical use. The use of AI in tree risk assessment not only supports the user but can also be used to disseminate knowledge and promote the standardization of decision-making in tree assessment. Important directions for further research and knowledge gaps related to the training of AI systems in the absence of industry-wide, agreed-upon criteria for risk identified in this project are: how to collect sufficient quality-assured data sets to define the initial set of rules; and how to assess the level of expertise of users training the system further. ©2022 International Society of Arboriculture.","2-s2.0-85170842350"

Therefore, the present study aimed to construct an emergency cesarean section (CS) prediction system using an AI-based rule extraction approach as a “white box” to detect the cause for the emergency CS. Methods: Data were collected from all perinatal records of all delivery outcomes at Osaka Medical College between December 2014 and July 2019. We identified the delivery method for all deliveries after 36 gestational weeks as either (1) vaginal delivery or scheduled CS, or (2) emergency CS. From among these, we selected 52 risk factors to feed into an AI-based rule extraction algorithm to extract rules to predict an emergency CS. Results: We identified 1513 singleton deliveries (1285 [84.9%] vaginal deliveries, 228 emergency CS [15.1%]) and extracted 15 rules. We achieved an average accuracy of 81.90% using five-fold cross-validation and an area under the receiving operating characteristic curve of 71.46%.

Expert surgeons integrate perceptual information through both conscious and subconscious awareness, and respond to the environment by leveraging their deep understanding of surgical constructs. However, their ability to utilize these deep knowledge structures can be complicated by continuous advances in technology, medical science, pharmacology, technique, materials, operative environments, etc. that must be routinely accommodated in professional practice. The demands on surgeons to perform perfectly in ever-changing contexts increases cognitive load, which could be reduced through judicious use of accurate and reliable artificial intelligence (AI) systems. AI has great potential to support human performance in complex environments such as surgery; however, the foundational requirements for the rules governing algorithmic development of performance requirements necessitate the active involvement of surgeons to precisely model the quantitative measures of performance along the continuum of expertise. Providing the AI development community with these data will help assure that accurate and reliable systems are designed to supplement human performance in applied surgical contexts.

In recent years, there has been increasing emphasis on resource recovery (reusing, recycling and extracting energy from waste) using more advanced approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI) in Australia. AI is a powerful technology that is increasingly gaining popularity and application in various fields. The adoption of AI techniques offers alternative innovative approaches to solid waste management (SWM). Although there are previous studies on AI technologies and SWM, no study has assessed the adoption of AI applications in solving the diverse SWM problems for achieving sustainable waste management in Australia. Moreover, there are inconsistencies and a lack of awareness on how AI technologies function in relation to their application to SWM. This study examines the application of AI technologies in various areas of SWM (generation, sorting, collection, vehicle routing, treatment, disposal and waste management planning) to enhance sustainable waste management practices in Australia. To achieve the aims of this study, prior studies from 2005 to 2021 from various databases are collected and analyzed. The study focuses on the adoption of AI applications on SWM, compares the performance of AI applications, explores the benefits and challenges, and provides best practice recommendations on how resource efficiency can be optimized to improve economic, environmental and social outcomes. This study found that AI-based models have better prediction abilities when compared to other models used in forecasting solid waste generation and recycling. Findings show that waste generation in Australia has been steadily increasing and requires upgraded and improved recovery infrastructure and the appropriate adoption of AI technologies to enhance sustainable SWM. Australia's adoption of AI recycling technologies would benefit from a national approach that seeks consistency across jurisdictions, while catering for regional differences. This study will benefit researchers, governments, policy-makers, municipalities and other waste management organizations to increase current recycling rates, eliminate the need for manual labor, reduce costs, maximize efficiency, and transform the way we approach the management of solid waste. © 2022","2-s2.0-85129295948"

To this end, we present a three-tiered hierarchical and modular spatial exploration model that combines the intrinsic motivation integrated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and rule-based real-time obstacle avoidance approach. We address the spatial exploration problem in two levels on the whole. On the higher level, a DRL based global module learns to determine a distant but easily reachable target that maximizes the current exploration progress. On the lower level, another two-level hierarchical movement controller is used to produce locally smooth and safe movements between targets based on the information of known areas and free space assumption. Experimental results on diverse and challenging 2D dynamic maps show that the proposed model achieves almost 90% coverage and generates smoother trajectories compared with a state-of-the-art IM based DRL and some other heuristic methods on the basis of avoiding obstacles in real time. © 2022 by the authors.

Methods: We chose a commercial chatbot platform and participatory methodology with a team of patient representatives, IT engineers, genetic counselors and clinical geneticists, within a nationwide collaboration. An iterative approach ensured extensive user and formal usability testing during the development process. Results: The development phase lasted for two years until the pilot version was completed in December 2019. The iteration steps disclosed major challenges in the artificial intelligence (AI)-based matching of user provided questions with predefined information in the database, leading initially to high level of fallback answers. We therefore developed strategies to reduce potential language ambiguities (e.g. BRCA1 vs BRCA2) and overcome dialogue confusion. The first prototype contained a database with 500 predefined questions and 67 corresponding predefined answers, while the final version included 2257 predefined questions and 144 predefined answers. Despite the limited AI functionality of the chatbot, the testing revealed that the users liked the layout and found the chatbot trustworthy and reader friendly. Conclusions: Building a health chatbot is challenging, expensive and time consuming with today's technology. The users had a positive attitude to the chatbot, and would use it in a real life setting, if given to them by health care personnel. Practice implications: We here present a framework for future health chatbot initiatives.

This so-called Artificial Intelligence Act (hereafter, the “Proposal”) is based on European values and fundamental rights. Far from appearing ex nihilo, it deeply relies on the European Ethics Guidelines proposed by the independent high-level expert group on AI set up by the European Commission. In addition, the European Commission’s White Paper on AI already called for a regulatory framework that should concentrate on a riskbased approach to AI regulation that minimises potential material and immaterial harms. The Proposal, internal market oriented, sets up a risk-based approach to AI regulation that distinguishes unacceptable, high, specific and non-high-risks. First, AI systems that produce unacceptable risk are prohibited by default. Second, those that generate high risk are subject to compliance with mandatory requirements such as transparency and human oversight. Third, AI systems interacting with natural persons have to respect transparency obligations. Fourth, developers and users of nonhigh-risk AI systems should voluntarily endorse requirements for high-risk AI systems. Exploring the origins of the AI Act and the ratione materiae dimension of the Proposal, this article argues that the very choice of what is a high-risk AI system and the astounding complexity of this definition are open to criticism. Rather than a fullextent analysis of the Proposal’s requirements, the article focuses on the definition of what is an unacceptable, high, specific and non-high-risk AI system. With a strong emphasis on high-risk AI systems, the Commission comes dangerously close to the pitfall this article humorously labels as the Humpty Dumpty fallacy, to pay tribute to the nineteenth century English author Lewis Carroll. Just because the Commission exhaustively enumerates high-risk AI systems does not mean the residual category displays non-high-risk. To support this argument, this article introduces recommender systems for consumers and competition law enforcement authorities. Neither of these two examples fall under the AI Act scope of application. Yet, the issues they have raised might well be qualified as high-risk in a different context. In addition, the AI Act, although inapplicable, could have provided a solution. © 2022, Universidade Catolica Editora. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-85139771577"

This can reduce the need for labelled data across a range of downstream tasks. It was hypothesised that wave segmentation would be a useful form of electrocardiogram (ECG) representation learning. In addition to reducing labelled data requirements, segmentation masks may provide a mechanism for explainable AI. This study details the development and evaluation of a Wave Segmentation Pretraining (WaSP) application. Materials and Methods: Pretraining: A non-AI-based ECG signal and image simulator was developed to generate ECGs and wave segmentation masks. U-Net models were trained to segment waves from synthetic ECGs. Dataset: The raw sample files from the PTB-XL dataset were downloaded. Each ECG was also plotted into an image. Fine-tuning and evaluation: A hold-out approach was used with a 60:20:20 training/validation/test set split. The encoder portions of the U-Net models were fine-tuned to classify PTB-XL ECGs for two tasks: sinus rhythm (SR) vs atrial fibrillation (AF), and myocardial infarction (MI) vs normal ECGs. The fine-tuning was repeated without pretraining. Results were compared. Explainable AI: an example pipeline combining AI-derived segmentation masks and a rule-based AF detector was developed and evaluated. Results: WaSP consistently improved model performance on downstream tasks for both ECG signals and images. The difference between non-pretrained models and models pretrained for wave segmentation was particularly marked for ECG image analysis. A selection of segmentation masks are shown. An AF detection algorithm comprising both AI and rule-based components performed less well than end-to-end AI models but its outputs are proposed to be highly explainable. An example output is shown. Conclusion: WaSP using synthetic data and labels allows AI models to learn useful features for downstream ECG analysis with real-world data. Segmentation masks provide an intermediate output that may facilitate confidence calibration in the context of end-to-end AI. It is possible to combine AI-derived segmentation masks and rule-based diagnostic classifiers for explainable ECG analysis.

Thus, the digitalization of energy utilities presents itself as an important and crucial process. A concept that involves a variety of innovative trends is the digital twin. It consists of a 3D virtual replica of existing physical objects and real-time monitoring of certain measures. By developing a digital twin in the electrical power grid, a virtual replica of the network is obtained providing network virtual maps, 3D asset models, dynamic and real-time data of grid assets, and IoT sensing. All these data can feed a platform where AI-based models and advanced field operation technologies and solutions will be applied. With a Network Digital Twin©development, applications involving on-field activities can be improved through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) to enhance workforce operations. This paper discusses the best practices for the development of a digital twin for the electrical power sector. These practices were found during the development of a project carried out by Enel Distribuição São Paulo, applying a living lab concept in the densest region of Brazil. The results of this paper present 3D images captured with specialized tools, and how they influence the workforce activities of human interface operation.

An understanding of the basics of AI applications, their development, and challenges to their clinical implementation is important for clinicians to fully appreciate the possibilities of AI. Such a foundation would ensure that clinicians have a good grasp and realistic expectations for AI in medicine and prevent discrepancies between the promised and real-world impact. When quantifying the track record for AI applications in cardiology, we found that a substantial number of AI systems are never deployed in clinical practice, although there certainly are many success stories. Successful implementations shared the following: they came from clinical areas where large amount of training data was available; were deployable into a single diagnostic modality; prediction models generally had high performance in external validation; and most were developed as part of collaborations with medical device manufacturers who had substantial experience with implementation of new clinical technology. When looking into the current processes used for developing AI-based systems, we suggest that expanding the analytic framework to address potential deployment and implementation issues at project outset will improve the rate of successful implementation, and will be a necessary next step for AI to achieve its full potential in cardiovascular medicine. © 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society","2-s2.0-85122266625"

We aim to investigate the performance of the system in real-world clinical settings and compare its effectiveness to the in-lab performance. Method: The AI system was directly integrated into the Hospital's Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) after being trained on a fixed annotated dataset from other sources. The system's performance was prospectively measured by matching and comparing the AI results with the radiology reports of 6,285 chest X-ray examinations extracted from the Hospital Information System (HIS) over the last 2 months of 2020. The normal/abnormal status of a radiology report was determined by a set of rules and served as the ground truth. Results: Our system achieves an F1 score—the harmonic average of the recall and the precision—of 0.653 (95% CI 0.635, 0.671) for detecting any abnormalities on chest X-rays. This corresponds to an accuracy of 79.6%, a sensitivity of 68.6%, and a specificity of 83.9%. Conclusions: Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems for chest radiographs using artificial intelligence (AI) have recently shown great potential as a second opinion for radiologists. However, the performances of such systems were mostly evaluated on a fixed dataset in a retrospective manner and, thus, far from the real performances in clinical practice. Despite a significant drop from the in-lab performance, our result establishes a reasonable level of confidence in applying such a system in real-life situations.

This study’s goal was to demonstrate that using personalized interventions can significantly increase patient adherence. Method Ninety-five patients (ages 18–90) eligible for the CR program were randomly recruited and received personalized interventions using the Well-Beat system. Adherence levels were compared to those of a historical control group. The Well-Beat system provided Sheba CR Health Care Provider (HCP) guidelines for personalized patient-therapist dialogue. The system also generated ongoing personalized text messages for each patient sent twice a week and related each patient’s dynamic profile to their daily behavior, creating continuity, and reinforcing the desired behavior. Results A significant increase in patient adherence to the CR program: Three months after initiation, 76% remained active compared to the historical average of 24% in the matched control group (log-rank p-value = 0.001). Conclusions Using an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based engine that generated recommendations and messages made it possible to improve patient adherence without increasing HCP load, benefiting all.

However, subsurface problems are complex and non-linear, and making reliable decisions in reservoir management requires substantial computational effort. Proxy models have gained much attention in recent years. They are advanced non-linear interpolation tables that can approximate complex models and alleviate computational effort. Proxy models are constructed by running high-fidelity models to gather the necessary data to create the proxy model. Once constructed, they can be a great choice for different tasks such as uncertainty analysis, optimization, forecasting, etc. The application of proxy modeling in oil and gas has had an increasing trend in recent years, and there is no consensus rule on the correct choice of proxy model. As a result, it is crucial to better understand the advantages and disadvantages of various proxy models. The existing work in the literature does not comprehensively cover all proxy model types, and there is a considerable requirement for fulfilling the existing gaps in summarizing the classification techniques with their applications. We propose a novel categorization method covering all proxy model types. This review paper provides a more comprehensive guideline on comparing and developing a proxy model compared to the existing literature. Furthermore, we point out the advantages of smart proxy models (SPM) compared to traditional proxy models (TPM) and suggest how we may further improve SPM accuracy where the literature is limited. This review paper first introduces proxy models and shows how they are classified in the literature. Then, it explains that the current classifications cannot cover all types of proxy models and proposes a novel categorization based on various development strategies. This new categorization includes four groups multi-fidelity models (MFM), reduced-order models (ROM), TPM, and SPM. MFMs are constructed based on simplifying physics assumptions (e.g., coarser discretization), and ROMs are based on dimensional reduction (i.e., neglecting irrelevant parameters). Developing these two models requires an in-depth knowledge of the problem. In contrast, TPMs and novel SPMs require less effort. In other words, they do not solve the complex underlying mathematical equations of the problem; instead, they decouple the mathematical equations into a numeric dataset and train statistical/AI-driven models on the dataset. Nevertheless, SPMs implement feature engineering techniques (i.e., generating new parameters) for its development and can capture the complexities within the reservoir, such as the constraints and characteristics of the grids. The newly introduced parameters can help find the hidden patterns within the parameters, which eventually increase the accuracy of SPMs compared to the TPMs. This review highlights the superiority of SPM over traditional statistical/AI-based proxy models. Finally, the application of various proxy models in the oil and gas industry, especially in subsurface modeling with a set of real examples, is presented. The introduced guideline in this review aids the researchers in obtaining valuable information on the current state of PM problems in the oil and gas industry. © 2022 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85137347615"

Teachers’ perceptions of AI utilization have only been investigated by only few scholars due an overall lack of experience of teachers regarding how AI can be utilized in the classroom as well as no specific idea of what AI-adopted tools would be like. This study investigated how teachers perceived an AI-enhanced scaffolding system developed to support students’ scientific writing for STEM education. Results revealed that most STEM teachers positively experienced AI as a source for superior scaffolding. On the other hand, they also raised the possibility of several issues caused by using AI such as the change in the role played by the teachers in the classroom and the transparency of the decisions made by the AI system. These results can be used as a foundation for which to create guidelines for the future integration of AI with STEM education in schools, since it reports teachers’ experiences utilizing the system and various considerations regarding its implementation.

In order to carry out these revamping activities, the plant owners exchange many purchase orders (POs) with equipment suppliers, including technical and specification documents and commercial procurement content. As POs are written in various formats with large volumes and complexities, it is often time-consuming for the owner’s engineer to review them and it may lead to errors and omissions. This study proposed the purchase order recognition and analysis system (PORAS), which automatically detects and compares risk clauses between plant owners’ and suppliers’ POs by utilizing artificial intelligence (AI). The PORAS is a comprehensive framework consisting of two independent modules and four model components that accurately reflect on the added value of the PORAS. The table recognition and comparison (TRC) module is utilized for risk clauses in POs written in tables with its two components, the table comparison (TRC-C) and table recognition (TRC-R) models. The critical terms in general conditions (CTGC) module analyzes the patterns of risk clauses in general texts, then extracts them with a rule-based algorithm and compares them through entity matching. In the TRC-C model using machine learning (Ditto model), a few errors occurred due to insufficient training data, resulting in an accuracy of 87.8%, whereas in the TRC-R model, a rule-based algorithm, errors occurred in only some exceptional cases; thus, its F1 score was evaluated to be 96.9%. The CTGC module’s F2 score for automatic extraction performance was evaluated as 79.1% due to some data’s bias. Overall, the validation study shows that while a human review of the risk clauses in a PO manually took hours, it took only an average of 10 min with the PORAS. Therefore, this time saving can significantly reduce the owner engineer’s PO workload. In essence, this study contributes to achieving sustainable engineering processes through the intelligence and automation of document and risk management in the plant industry. © 2022 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85137682276"

This bridging review, which consolidates information from the diverse applications of AI, highlights how AI users can investigate more sophisticated queries than with traditional methods, leading to synthesis of raw data and complex outputs into more actionable and personalised results, particularly in the field of uro-oncology. Methods: Literature and clinical trial searches were performed in PubMed, Dimensions, Embase and Google (1999–2020). The searches focussed on the use of AI and its various forms to facilitate literature searches, clinical guidelines development, and clinical trial data extraction in uro-oncology. To illustrate how AI can be applied to address questions about optimising therapeutic decision making and individualising treatment regimens, the Dimensions-linked information platform was searched for ‘prostate cancer’ keywords (76 publications were identified; 48 were included). Results: AI offers the promise of transforming raw data and complex outputs into actionable insights. Literature and clinical trial searches can be automated, enabling clinicians to develop and analyse publications expeditiously on complex issues such as therapeutic sequencing and to obtain updates on documents that evolve at the pace and scope of the landscape. An AI-based platform inclusive of 12 trial databases and >100 scientific literature sources enabled the creation of an interactive visualisation. Conclusion: As the literature and clinical trial landscape continues to grow in complexity and with increasing speed, the ability to pull the right information at the right time from different search engines and resources, while excluding social media bias, becomes more challenging. This review demonstrates that by applying natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, validated and optimised AI leads to a speedier, more personalised, efficient, and focussed search compared with traditional methods. © 2021 Pfizer Inc.

Heterogeneity in such AI systems creates an ongoing need to analyse performance to inform future research. This systematic literature review aimed to investigate performance and reporting of diagnostic AI systems using machine learning (ML) for pneumonia detection based on symptoms and signs, and to provide recommendations on best practices for designing and implementing predictive ML algorithms. This article was conducted following the PRISMA protocol, 876 articles were identified by searching PubMed, Scopus, and OvidSP databases (last search 5th May 2021). For inclusion, studies must have differentiated clinically diagnosed pneumonia from controls or other diseases using AI. Risk of Bias was evaluated using The STARD 2015 tool. Information was extracted from 16 included studies regarding study characteristics, ML-model features, reference tests, study population, accuracy measures and ethical aspects. All included studies were highly heterogenous concerning the study design, setting of diagnosis, study population and ML algorithm. Study reporting quality in methodology and results was low. Ethical issues surrounding design and implementation of the AI algorithms were not well explored. Although no single performance measure was used in all studies, most reported an accuracy measure over 90%. There is strong evidence to support further investigations of ML to automatically detect pneumonia based on easily recognisable symptoms and signs. To help improve the efficacy of future research, recommendations for designing and implementing AI tools based on the findings of this study are provided. © 2021","2-s2.0-85118851096"

In order to effectively collaborate with humans and ensure safety, AI systems need to be able to understand, interpret and predict human moral judgments and decisions. Human moral judgments are often guided by rules, but not always. A central challenge for AI safety is capturing the flexibility of the human moral mind - the ability to determine when a rule should be broken, especially in novel or unusual situations. In this paper, we present a novel challenge set consisting of moral exception question answering (MoralExceptQA) of cases that involve potentially permissible moral exceptions - inspired by recent moral psychology studies. Using a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) as a basis, we propose a novel moral chain of thought (MORALCOT) prompting strategy that combines the strengths of LLMs with theories of moral reasoning developed in cognitive science to predict human moral judgments. MORALCOT outperforms seven existing LLMs by 6.2% F1, suggesting that modeling human reasoning might be necessary to capture the flexibility of the human moral mind. We also conduct a detailed error analysis to suggest directions for future work to improve AI safety using MoralExceptQA. © 2022 Neural information processing systems foundation.

We have investigated how a public chatbot operates in actual practice and how it answers the citizens’ questions about the rules and regulations for welfare benefits. We use the concept of citizens’ information needs to determine the quality of the chatbot’s answers. Information needs are often not formulated from the start as answerable questions. We analyse logs from chat sessions between the chatbot and the citizens, and focus on problems that arise, e.g., that the chatbot gives irrelevant answers or omits important information.

Also, a recurrent neural network was developed to predict the input voltage of the damper required to generate its actual force. The fuzzy controller rules are designed based on minimizing the vehicle body acceleration. The neural network is trained using the synthetic data produced from the modified Bouc-Wen model. The performance of the proposed hybrid AI-based method was evaluated by applying it to a full suspension system model incorporating an MR damper model with 7-DOF riding on a bumpy road.

Objective: To build an automatic crisis balance analysis model based on artificial intelligence which can perform automatic early suicide identification, suicide risk classification and analyze cognitive distortion and interpersonal relationship of users. Then to validate the predictive efficiency of model. Method: Firstly, based on the suicide knowledge graph, free annotation data set was generated and then Bert-based model was built. Secondly, the data set was refined by psychology students and experts to build fine-tuning model and Psychology+ model. The Psychology+ model was used as final suicide risk assessment model. We enriched and quantified the variables of cognitive and interpersonal characteristics and built the cognitive distortion and interpersonal relationship analysis model. Using F1 score, precision, recall and accuracy to evaluate the model performance and the consistence of model results with expert judgment and scales results to evaluate the model prediction ability. Results: For the suicide risk assessment model, the F1 score, precision, recall rate and accuracy rate of the model are 77.98%, 80.75%, 75.41% and 78.68% respectively. For the cognitive distortion and interpersonal relationship analysis model, the F1 score, accuracy and recall rate of the model are 77.26%, 78.22% and 76.33% respectively. Comparing the results with the results of the scale by chi square test, there was no significant difference in cognitive distortion(P = 0.521) and interpersonal relationship(P = 0.189) aspect.

The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies is on the rise everywhere in the space industry. AI allows the rapid analysis of millions of events and identifies a wide range of threats - from malware exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities to the identification of risky behaviours that may lead to a phishing attack or the download of malicious code. These systems learn over time, they identify new types of attacks, by analysing the behavioural history of user profiles, assets and networks and respond on time to deviations from established norms. This paper attempts to answer the question of whether or not AI can be used to prevent cyber attacks in space and explores this new avenue of AI being utilized in the space cyber security domain.

However, most of the communication between students and educational institutions is still performed physically and causes major administrative overhead, especially during the time of admission. Contemporary pattern-matching-based and generative-based chatbots underperform to queries outside a limited scope, grammatically and structurally ambiguous inputs, outliers to pre-defined rule-set, and longer response times for a huge knowledge base. We proposed a NEdBOT-An NLP-based Educational Bot, developed by Natural Language Processing models integrated within the DialogFlow platform utilizing a Retrieval-based approach. We evaluate the developed chatbot on a custom dataset generated for the admissions use case of a prominent university. We used an objective evaluation criterion with real-world users to achieve an intent classification accuracy of 76.8% at an average mean response time of 216.43ms per query and a user-friendliness score of 72% on the System Usability Scale (SUS).

COVID-19 spread over the world at an unprecedented rate. In this context, we undertook a rapid research project in the Sultanate of Oman. We developed ecovid19 application, an ontology-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) with teleconference capability for easy, fast diagnosis and treatment for primary health centers/Satellite Clinics of the Royal Oman Police (ROP) of Sultanate of Oman. Material and Methods: The domain knowledge and clinical guidelines are represented using ontology. Ontology is one of the most powerful methods for formally encoding medical knowledge. The primary data was from the ROP hospital's medical team, while the secondary data came from articles published in reputable journals. The application includes a COVID-19 Symptom checker for the public users with a text interface and an AI-based voice interface and is available in English and Arabic. Based on the given information, the symptom checker provides recommendations to the user. The suspected cases will be directed to the nearby clinic if the risk of infection is high. Based on the patient's current medical condition in the clinic, the CDSS will make suitable suggestions to triage staff, doctors, radiologists, and lab technicians on procedures and medicines. We used Teachable Machine to create a TensorFlow model for the analysis of X-rays. Our CDSS also has a WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication system) based teleconferencing option for communicating with expert clinicians if the patient develops difficulties or if expert opinion is requested. Results: The ROP hospital's specialized doctors tested our CDSS, and the user interfaces were changed based on their suggestions and recommendations. The team put numerous types of test cases to assess the clinical efficacy. Precision, sensitivity (recall), specificity, and accuracy were adequate in predicting the various categories of patient instances. Conclusion: The proposed CDSS has the potential to significantly improve the quality of care provided to Oman's citizens. It can also be tailored to fit other terrifying pandemics. © 2022, Published by Frontiers in Health Informatics.","2-s2.0-85158080489"

EBM is therefore a systematic approach to decision-making that integrates these three inputs. It involves evidence production (design and conducting of clinical studies), synthesis (collecting, appraising, and combining data to answer clinical questions), implementation (e.g., through clinical practice guidelines based on these syntheses), and evaluation (monitoring the quality of care, including adherence to evidence-based recommendations). EBM faces many challenges that artificial intelligence can help solve. It can help detect research gaps and avoid funding redundant studies. It can expedite the evidence synthesis process, which currently is slow and costly, leading to outdated and incomplete evidence being used in the decision-making processes. AI can help engage patients and elicit values (e.g., chatbot-based decision aids) as well as provide coordinated care for patients with multimorbidities. However, improperly implementing AI can also exacerbate problems in EBM. For instance, if AI-enabled decision support systems fail to incorporate patient values, a return to a model of medicine characterized by low patient autonomy is possible - only this time with a computer in charge. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","2-s2.0-85159024585"

The following summary and recommendations are made for future work in the area of innovative experimental methods in ships and offshore industry. It is important to also note that as experimental techniques allow for a greater understanding of the underlying material and structural behaviour, and generate extensive data clouds for processing and evaluation. As a result, we recommend that a future chapter in the next committee report focus on data evaluation and statistical approaches; this can provide an in-depth look of state of the art of processes utilized for evaluating the extensive data captured/utilized during experiments. In chapter 2, a review of scaling laws is presented in systematic and recent advancements in structural testing related to ships and offshore structures. General scale modelling methods are provided and described the main characteristics of each method such as dimensional analysis, applied to governing equation, energy method, empirical similarity method through the literature review. Recent application of scale models can be found in field of offshore wind turbine structure and ice testing area. These structures are subjected to complex phenomena such as wave loads and drifting forces may also need to be considered in particular applications, ice flows, continuous winter sea ice, and icebergs. Application DIC in chapter 3, DIC techniques have certainly come into play in many recent experimental evaluations, as the methods allows for elucidating the surface strain behaviour of a component evaluated either in the laboratory and in the field. This chapter has been to give an updated review on applications of DIC techniques in ships and offshore structural tests classifying them by test articles, with a brief insight on commercial instrumentations available on the industry and related to DIC society and a deeper focus on the applied methodologies, providing recent references for those who are interested in this topic. Worth mentioning is that some DIC applications are included in the benchmark study performed by the Committee and reported in section 15. In chapter 4, A large amount of research has focused on better measuring and predicting the hydrodynamic loads, forming several practical hydrodynamic coefficients databases which have been widely used in VIV prediction tools for flexible structure manufacturing industry. Although these databases make great contributions to the field of VIV research, have not been sufficiently modelled in the coefficient database obtained from rigid cylinder experiments. Recently, the phase angle between cross-flow and in-line response had a strong influence on the hydrodynamic coefficients for both rigid and flexible cylinders. And variations of tension and flow velocity were strongly correlated with time-varying hydrodynamic coefficients, therefore, inputs to the prediction of vessel motion induced VIVs, making the prediction possible. Also, the effects of Re numbers and surface roughness on hydrodynamics of VIV and the effect of wake interference on hydrodynamics of a twin-tube submerged floating tunnel (SFT) can be found for can efficient way and requirement in the literature. In chapter 5, based on the challenges remaining in the problem of wave-in-deck impact on offshore structures discussed above, there are several research gaps that can be addressed in future. There is still considerable uncertainty about the magnitude and distribution of wave impact loads on structural deck elements near the free-surface. Effects of the columns of the floating platform on the wave-in-deck forces have not been systematically studied. The measurement, estimation and simulation of local pressures due to wave-in-deck impact events on all types of offshore structures remains challenging. Accurate measurements and prediction of global loads and dynamic response of floating offshore structures due to wave-in-deck impact events is extremely limited. Combined numerical-experimental wave-in-deck investigations on floating offshore structures are not currently available in the open literature. In chapter 6, this chapter focused on hybrid model testing (HMT) combines physical model test and numerical simulations to solve problems that physical model tests alone cannot conveniently or reliably address. In marine model testing, the challenges like ultra-deep water, multi-phase fluids, parameter traversal and so on cannot be avoided. HMT is regarded as the most promising technique to solve these issues. As of today, HMT is still immature, some advanced applications however have been developed. HMT allows researchers to impose mass-spring-damping parameters in virtual space and can artificially adjust and precisely control these critical parameters. It is a very helpful and exciting idea to solve the involved problems. In Chapter 7, a brief reviewed of friction test in terms of two main areas exist where friction is of importance: machineries and mechanical connections, and in cargo/mechanical handling operations. For maritime and offshore applications (e.g. Out-of-Plane Bending), surface conditions and environmental conditions are important parameters. Small and the smaller specimens may be used for screening the theoretical friction coefficients and find trends. Larger or even real size specimens should be used to confirm the actual behaviour. As per the results of literature, friction tests can be split it eh standard, small size specimen standard tests, and the large size, more representative tests. While the standard tests are well covered by standards and guidelines, the larger set-ups are to be tailor made and require goo understanding of the physics as results require interpretation by the experimenter. In chapter 8, the measurement, analysis and mitigation of vibrations in ship and offshore structures is rather well established. Nevertheless, measurement and mitigation methods are still being developed. Measurement’s techniques may also include laser of video techniques. Mitigation measures include devices that cancel vibrations at a low weight penalty, such as absorbing supports or Tuned Mass Dampers. Numerical developments include methods that use sub-structuring or modal shapes to reduce the computational cost. In chapter 9, Material selection for ships and offshore structures exposed to sub-zero temperatures is traditionally based on Charpy and fracture toughness test results of the base materials and its welded connections. In the last years however, fatigue properties have been the focus of a couple of studies due to the acceleration of fatigue crack growth below the so-called fatigue transition temperature, where ductile crack growth is superimposed by cleavage burst. Concluding, fatigue testing at low temperatures demands special attention to the set-up and instrumentation. The testing temperature is normally lower than the application temperature, and liquid nitrogen may be needed to cool down the area of interest to -60 °C. Temperature compensation is required for sensor, either strain gauges or potential drop methods. In chapter 10, The corrosion process and the interpretation of the effect of corrosion on the structural integrity remains an area of uncertainty. In corrosion testing, a large spread may be observed in measured corrosion rates, as is confirmed by industrial thickness measurement. Including the geometrical effects of corrosion damage in a representative manner in numerical simulations requires the use of probabilistic methods, as a precise description would require model with too many details. Hence, simplifications and generalizations are needed. In chapter 11, large scale impact experimentation are unique options to verify developments in structures design, analysis and prediction of failure. In turn, this demands good command of the experimentation techniques, and the use of as many sensors as possible to make possible use of the results. In chapter 12, The chapter present a State-of-the-Art review, to include recent advances and future trends of industry challenge with current standard and out lookout. The wind industry is concerning with the long time-to-marked for future large turbine blades and are interested in ways to shorten the test time. It is a question at which size and when will it stop to make sense to test these long blades according to current standard. Trends of development of more advanced test methods investigated a dual or multi axis test methods to test blades under more representative loading compared to operational loads and ways to speed up the test and challenge with different SN-curves for different materials. Testing parts of blades captured testing with more complex and realistic loading at forced loading, challenges with boundaries, and using subcomponent testing to validate numerical models. In chapter 13, Full scale ice load measurements play a significant role in the design of ships and offshore structures in ice covered waters. Full scale measurements of fixed vertical offshore structure are dis-cussed here. Generalizability of the results can be summarised that as pointed out by Kärnä (2009) it is likely that the experimental data recorded on vertical structures is only applicable for the conditions where the data was record-ed. Thus, data recorded for stiff structures might not be applicable for compliant structures. As discussed before, the compliancy might be one source of the observed rate dependency. The collected data is often incomplete: although local and global ice forces can be recorded during ice action, the ice properties (compressive strength, porosity...) might remain unknown. It is because the ice samples cannot be taken during ice action - when ice is moving. Actual local pressure is challenging to measure. It is known that the ice pressure is concentrated in a small area as shown by Joensuu & Riska (1989). They observed in laboratory scale experiments using PVDF-film that the ice pressure is concentrated on narrow, line like high pressure zones. But, the area of the load panels in full scale of often quite big, in the order of 1 m2. Thus, the actual local pressure exerted to structure is significantly higher than the average pressure measured with the big load panels. But there is no method available for more accurate local pressure measurements in full scale. Although field tests are important and can reveal phenomena that cannot be observed in laboratory scale, there are few things to consider when interpreting the results. In chapter 14, Bridging the relationship between the degradation in the material and the structure is an emerging field of research which requires advanced data fusion, signal processing, AI-based trend detection algorithms and the reliability analysis methods. Data fusion herein refers to combining the data gathered from different SHM sensors by using data fusion algorithms for better damage diagnosis (Eleftheroglou et al., 2018). Other research efforts are recommended for improving the durability of SHM sensors for offshore implementations, inclusion of SHM in the condition monitoring standards and guidelines, addressing big-data issues for developing real-time data collection and analysis frameworks and using the digital twins for real-time reliability assessment. In the Benchmark study, from this relatively simple experiment performed by 6 parties, it is clear that a vast range of choices can be made to carry out the tests. Understanding the effect of the choices on the end result is essential. For instance, a heavy sensor influences the natural frequency a lot. Also, the chosen instrumentation influences the information to be gained from an experiment. Only the natural frequency, by manual excitation, or also damping and higher order modes when using an instrumented hammer. In order to understand the many experiments that are done worldwide, sharing of the results and being transparent on the methodologies of experimentation is very beneficial for making the most of any experiment. Experimental data should be published as is in digital format and not only as a by-product in a publication as figures limiting the use of it. © The Author(s), 2022.","2-s2.0-85158899064"

The United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report stated that mitigation measures in forests from 2010-2019 have delivered approximately 80% of carbon mitigation from Land Use sectors. Advancements in Remote Sensing (RS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies hold significant potential to increase the necessary coverage and speed of forestry management; however, there is a delay in the current capability integration due to technical, cost, and human-factor constraints that prevent adoption and deployment. This research details the formation of the ART3MIS-AI (Augmented Real-Time 3D Mapping with Intelligent Sensing AI) system framework, an AI-Augmentation framework design that minimizes these constraints. It is tailored for responsive deployment in forestry agencies and provides long-Term robustness and extensibility for all four functions of forestry management. Our research analyzes AI capabilities in forestry RS from 75 research papers and assesses the potential integration pathways of these capabilities into the post-processing infrastructures of RS within forestry management for augmented-data transformation and critical metric extraction. The ART3MIS-AI system framework optimizes these observed capabilities for additional high levels of interpretability and extensibility given the technical and sensing platform constraints of forestry agencies. We generated a set of objectives and guidelines to facilitate the responsive deployment and integration of AI-Augmentation frameworks within forestry agencies. The guidelines are based on established work in Human Machine Teaming, AI-Assurance, and prior research, in addition to consultation from our forestry professional partners in United States forestry agencies. The proposed ART3MIS-AI system framework is a detailed four-phase, automated and pipelined system implemented in Python and C++. It transforms RS imagery into ""Smart""Point Clouds with augmented hyperspectral information, vegetation classification, and structural mission metrics to an individual tree scale (canopy height/width, timber volume/fuel loading, species identification, etc.). The ART3MIS-AI system framework accelerates structured tactical data delivery to forestry professionals and provides capabilities in tailored virtual planning. The system framework design, integration analysis, and additional guidelines within this paper provide the foundations for the large-scale and methodological integration of AI-Augmentation into RS forestry conservation and restoration capabilities.  © 2022 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85153764476"

With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), many companies explore new technologies to improve well integrity and avoid catastrophic events. This paper presents the Proof of Concept (PoC) of an AI-based well integrity monitoring solution for gas lift, natural flow, and water injector wells. AI model prototypes were built to detect annulus leakage as incident-relevant anomalies from time series sensor data. The historical well annulus leakage incidents were classified based on well type and the incident relevant anomalies were categorized as short and long-term. The objective of the PoC is to build generalized AI models that could detect historical events and future events in unseen wells. The success criteria are discussed and agreed with the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Two statistical metrics were defined (Detected Event Rate - DER - and False Alarm Rate - FAR) to quantitively evaluate the model performance and decide if it could be used for the next phase. The high frequency sensor data were retrieved from the production historian. The importance of the sensor was aligned with the SMEs and only a small number of sensors was used as input variable. The raw data was pre-processed and resampled to improve model performance and increase computational efficiency. Throughout the PoC, the authors learnt that specific AI models needed to be implemented for different well types as generalization across well types could not be achieved. Depending on the number of available labels in the training dataset, either unsupervised or supervised ML models were developed. Deep learning models, based on LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) autoencoder and classifier were used to detect complex anomalies. In cases where limited data were available and simplistic anomaly patterns were present, deterministic rules were implemented to detect well integrity-relevant incidents. The LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) framework was used to derive the most important sensors causing the anomaly prediction to enable the users to critically validate the AI suggestion. The AI models for gas lift and natural flow wells achieved a sufficient level of performance with a minimum of 75% of historical events detected and less than one false positive per month per well.

Customer churn forecast is a difficult problem in many corporate sectors, particularly the telecommunications industry. Because customer churns have a direct impact on a company's total revenue, telecommunications firms have begun to develop 76 models to reduce churns at an earlier stage. Previous research has revealed that AI and ML models are effective CCP solutions. According to this viewpoint, this study proposes a unique AI-based CCP model for Telecommunication Business Markets (AICCP-TBM). The AICCP-TBM model's purpose is to control the existence of churners and non-churners in the telecom sector. The proposed AICCP-TBM model employs a Chaotic Salp Swarm Optimization-based Feature Selection (CSSO-FS) method for the best feature assortment. In addition, a Fuzzy Rule-based Classifier(FRC) is used to distinguish between client churners and non-churners. A technique known as Quantum Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) is used to pick the membership functions for the FRC model in order to improve the classification performance of the FRC model. The performance of the AICCP-TBM model is validated using a benchmark CCP dataset and the experimental results are reviewed from several angles. In relations of presentation, the imitation consequences demonstrated that the AICCP-TBM model surpassed the most recent state-of-the-art CPP models. The suggested AICCP-TBM method's comparative accuracy was thoroughly tested on the three datasets used. Using datasets 1-3, this technique obtained better levels of accuracy, with the maximum attainable values being 97.25 %, 97.5 % and 94.33 %. The simulation results for the AICCP-TBM model demonstrated improved prediction performance.  © 2022 J. Faritha Banu et al.","2-s2.0-85139729739"

We move from the acknowledgment that machine learning models are being increasingly applied to textual data contained in legal materials for the prediction of outcomes regarding the legal position of citizens, in terms, for example, of discovery review, contract analytics and legal research. In this respect, the analysis gives account of ongoing transformations in the market of Artificial Intellinge (AI)-supported legal services, with the aim of rooting in the market reality the relevant regulatory framework. In our understanding, the analysis related to the risks connected to the employment of AI-driven legal decision-making tools delivered by the market triggers the question whether the applicable ethical-legal framework provides sufficient tools for addressing the current developments in the market of AI-assisted legal services or whether additional sector-specific solutions need to be introduced. The analysis identifies a gap it intends to fill between the blooming market reality and the ethical and legal perspectives. The uncertainties stemming from a vague ethical and legal framework must be overcome so as to better operationalise and protect fundamental ethical values and fundamental rights in the market of artificial intelligence-driven legal services. Against this backdrop, the study demonstrates how possible solutions against ethics/market mismatches are provided by the legal system, which can work as a bridge vehiculating into the market practice of AI-based legal decision-making tools declared ethical principles, while preventing eventual chilling effects on the market. It thus shows how these need to be adequately matched and integrated with legal design requirements to maximise the resulting positive synergies within the market and thus avoid risks of ethical dilution. In this respect, a layered regulatory regime is proposed for artificial intelligence-driven legal services, of both public and private destination. This framework is meant to operationalise general ethical values and fundamental legal liberties within the more specific regulatory framework given by the European data protection, the Open Data, the European competition framework and the European Commission’s newly proposed rules for artificial intelligence. © 2022 Edizioni Scientifiche Italiane SpA.

Initially deployed by Google to predict text input on mobile devices, FL has been deployed in many other industries. Since its introduction, Federated Learning mainly exploited the inner working of neural networks and other gradient descent-based algorithms by either exchanging the weights of the model or the gradients computed during learning. While this approach has been very successful, it rules out applying FL in contexts where other models are preferred, e.g., easier to interpret or known to work better. This paper proposes FL algorithms that build federated models without relying on gradient descent-based methods. Specifically, we leverage distributed versions of the AdaBoost algorithm to acquire strong federated models. In contrast with previous approaches, our proposal does not put any constraint on the client-side learning models. We perform a large set of experiments on ten UCI datasets, comparing the algorithms in six non-iidness settings. © 2022 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85140794272"

Most applications of AI focus on the development of connected and autonomous cars, rather than the optimisation of automotive operations and manufacturing processes. This work, therefore, bridged this gap and shed light on the topic of AI in the context of automotive manufacturing and Industry 4.0. It aimed to promote understanding and provide up-to-date insights on specific models and methods of AI, applications that have been achieved with best practices as well as the problems that were encountered, underpinned with possible future prospects. A systematic literature review approach was adopted to ensure broad and thorough coverage of current knowledge and the identification of relevant literature on the topic. The literature search was confined to papers that were published from 2015 onwards using the databases of IEEE and ScienceDirect as primary sources, with a three-keyword search phrase to narrow down the results and increase specificity. A total of 359 papers were identified and subsequently screened for eligibility, of which 84 papers were selected for quantitative and 79 papers for qualitative analysis. The results of the quantitative analysis confirmed that the topic has markedly increased in significance, with a mere 3 papers published in 2015 and 33 papers in 2021. The majority of papers dealt with solving problems in production (39.29%), quality (35.71%) and assembly (16.67%), whereas supply chain (5.95%) and business intelligence (2.38%) were inadequately represented. The results of the qualitative analysis revealed that machine learning methods dominate current research and automotive applications, with neural networks as the most used out of more than 70 identified models. The industrial applicability was confirmed by many use cases including quality inspection, robot assembly, human–robot collaboration, material demand prediction or AI-enabled manufacturing decision making. The problems of such applications were mainly attributed to data availability and quality, model development and gaps in simulation, system integration, the complexity of automotive processes, the physical conditions of the system environment and dynamic change. For industrial applications it is thus recommended to further optimise AI methods and models, enabling a wider system integration by harvesting the potential of big data and both edge and cloud computing. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85139436067"

However, with the deeper integration of AI-enabled system decision making in related industries, accidents also happen frequently. It has been found that AI-enabled systems, while superhuman in certain abilities, are subject to endogenous risks such as black box, bias, security, and unaccountability; people also have trust concerns when interacting with AI-enabled systems. These together lead to a crisis of trust in AI-enabled system decision-making. Especially in high-risk scenarios, wrong predictions and bad decisions of AI-enabled systems will lead to unbearable consequences for people. In order to cope with the abovementioned risks and uncertainties, trustworthy decision making for AI-enabled systems is widely discussed in academia and has become a hot research topic of great interest. This paper systematically reviews the research progress and challenges of trustworthy decision making for AI-enabled systems, including its risk sources, method application research and its limitations, and proposes a collaborative human-machine trustworthy framework throughout the AI development lifecycle, and provides an outlook of future research. This paper first analyzes the risk sources affecting the trustworthy decision making of AI-enabled systems and finds that the risks mainly originate from two aspects, namely, the endogenous risk of itself and the trust problem in human-computer interaction, by summarizing the existing research on the application of AI-enabled systems. The former is mainly the model perspective and data-driven endogenous risk, including the unexplainable risk and unaccountable risk caused by the black-box characteristics of AI models, as well as the unfair risk caused by data bias and unreliability risk caused by data security, etc. The latter is the trust risk arising from the need to entrust AI to make decisions unilaterally or adopt human-machine collaborative decision making, and these above-mentioned risks seriously affect users' trust in AI system adoption and decision making. Next, this paper focuses on the research progress related to trustworthy decision making of AI-enabled systems from the perspective of risk sources of AI-enabled systems, including models, data, and trust. Specifically, we analyze the research progress from the trend of literature on trusted AI research to the interpretability and accountability of AI models, from fairness of big data decision making to data security and summarize the research progress from the perspective of risk sources, ethical guidelines, and industry applications to make a preliminary analysis of industry heterogeneity and common patterns of trusted AI. Through the analysis of related literature in this paper, it is clear that the research on the academic issues of trustworthy decision making for AI-enabled systems is still in its infancy: the priority relationships and internal boundaries between various ethical principles are not clearly delineated and defined, and the attention to the heterogeneity and common laws of AI decision making in different risk levels and application industries is insufficient, and there are many issues worth exploring. Then, this paper analyzes the challenges of credible decision making in multiple uncertainty contexts under a management perspective, including continuous trust, multiple uncertainties, and the construction of human-machine teams, and then proposes a guiding human-machine collaborative credible framework. From the management perspective, the trustworthy decision making of AIenabled systems is a continuous organic holistic system covering the whole lifecycle of AI-enabled systems, which needs to simultaneously satisfy interpretability, fairness, security privacy, and accountability, also to gain trust in human-machine interaction in order to effectively enhance the trustworthiness of AI-enabled system applications and decisions. Finally, this paper provides an outlook on trustworthy decision-making for AI-enabled systems, including trustworthy humancomputer collaboration team formation, cross-organizational trusted decision-making problems, trusted AI regulatory challenges, and metrics and standards for AI trusted decision-making. In the future, the research on trustworthy decision making of of AI-enabled systems will be more in-depth, thus providing more theoretical and practical values for the development of human society. © 2022, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management","2-s2.0-85149735832"

With the increased population of ESPs deployed worldwide, a comprehensive alarm triggering system is at the center of modern oilfield production surveillance systems. In this paper, a data-driven ESP smart alarm suite, integrated with a virtual flowmeter (VFM) deployed on the Edge, is presented with testing results and field applications for effectiveness demonstration. The overall Smart Alarm Suite consists of eight different alarms, each targeting a specific potential suboptimal pump working condition. For three alarms, a data-driven approach is adopted with the application of multiple classical machine learning models such as logistics regression, K-Means clustering, continuous linear regression, etc. The workflow also uses hybrid pipelines when manual labeling is not sufficient for model training. For the other five alarms, the workflow uses an Edge-enabled physics-based flowrate calculation to flag the status of different alarm categories. The presented workflow innovatively combines machine-learning algorithms with rule-based criteria and a robust VFM to raise awareness of the ESP performance conditions. The injection of domain expertise and physical modeling into AI-based workflows improves the robustness of the algorithm and reduces false alarms with limited data exposure. The completeness of the alarms promotes more comprehensive monitoring of the assets and reduces the risk of lost production due to ESP failure or downtime.

Recently, the application of AI to additional functionalities like calibration and gear shifting has been presented. These examples show that there are various opportunities that can benefit from AI. Besides advancements in the functional improvement of AI based systems, the testing of AI based systems needs an extension of existing best practices to reflect the specific characteristics of learning systems. In short, testing an AI driven module or component means testing 1.) that the code is correct, 2.) what has been learned from the training cases, and most important 3.) what has not been learned. Four principles for Deep AI Testing have been proposed to improve the evidence that an AI based system is compliant with the requirements: 1. Independence of test data from training data; 2. Frequent full testing; 3. Improvement of test data base; 4. Data augmentation. These four principles of AI testing need to be applied to AI based modules and components. In this paper we introduce evidence levels for AI based testing and provide a concept of a comprehensive test strategy for systems based on AI. Why is this an important contribution? In the Machine Learning literature, the research is mostly focusing on improvements in learning and generalization ability. In the application of AI in the automotive industry, the focus is on performance, Functional Safety and Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF). The definition of a comprehensive test strategy is left in the background in both communities. In this presentation we propose a test strategy concept that will guide the definition of efficient and effective test strategies based on Evidence Levels of AI (ELAI). The underlying principles should be spread in the automotive industry and become part of standards, especially for selflearning vehicles. © 2022, VDI Verlag GMBH.

This problem and these questions have therefore become the subject of this paper.

In this paper, we first survey current approaches to moral AIs and their inherent limitations. Then we propose the pluralist hybrid approach and show how these limitations of moral AIs can be partly alleviated by the pluralist hybrid approach. The core ethical decision-making capacity of an AI based on the pluralist hybrid approach consists of two systems. The first is a deterministic algorithm system that embraces different moral rules for making explicit moral decisions. The second is a machine learning system that accounts for calculating the value of the variables required by the application of moral principles. The pluralist hybrid system is better than the existing proposals as it better addresses the moral disagreement problem of the top-down approach by including distinct moral principles. Besides, the pluralist hybrid system reduces the opacity of ethical decision-making by implementing explicit moral principles for moral decision-making. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85142667938"

Mandatory tasks like environment perception and scene understanding challenge existing rule-based methods. Thus, data-driven technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been introduced to automotive software development. Utilizing data in the development process has become essential as these systems are no longer developed with classical systems engineering methods, but rather by deriving requirements from and training the algorithms with recorded real-world data. This entails the introduction of data-driven workflows and data-management as new aspects of Automotive Systems Engineering (ASE). Tasks related to the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) software differ from their classical engineering and programming counterparts. Thus, engineers require new tools and methods for developing safe and accurate AI-based software and handling data efficiently during ASE. Another important aspect of data-driven development is ensuring data quality throughout the systems engineering process. Hence, this paper aims to take a step towards the introduction of a data engineering process in data-driven automotive systems engineering.

This opacity raises ethical and legal concerns regarding the real-life use of such models, especially in critical domains such as in medicine, and has led to the emergence of the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) field of research, which aims to make the operation of opaque AI systems more comprehensible to humans. The problem of explaining a black-box classifier is often approached by feeding it data and observing its behaviour. In this work, we feed the classifier with data that are part of a knowledge graph, and describe the behaviour with rules that are expressed in the terminology of the knowledge graph, that is understandable by humans. We first theoretically investigate the problem to provide guarantees for the extracted rules and then we investigate the relation of “explanation rules for a specific class” with “semantic queries collecting from the knowledge graph the instances classified by the black-box classifier to this specific class”. Thus we approach the problem of extracting explanation rules as a semantic query reverse engineering problem. We develop algorithms for solving this inverse problem as a heuristic search in the space of semantic queries and we evaluate the proposed algorithms on four simulated use-cases and discuss the results. © 2023 – The authors.","2-s2.0-85176397455"

However, there is also an increasing demand for long-term care. The Ministry of Welfare of Taiwan (2016) estimated that the population requiring long-term care will increase from 577,457 residents in 2017 to 771,431 in 2026, with a growing elderly population aged 65 years and older. In this chapter, we present a case study titled ‘Artificial Intelligence (AI) Smart Camera: Developing Deep Learning Prediction Model on Pressure Ulcer Changes in Long-Term Bedridden Patients,’ which aims to use artificial intelligence to build an algorithm for pressure ulcer detection (Ministry of Science and Technology Industry 2021). The researchers combined daily videos of patients’ activity and medical records to build a model to detect individual needs to prevent infection risks and reduce complications. Within one year of this study, four different pressure ulcer cases were collected in the clinic, including 824 sets of daily photos. Nearly 300 videos of pressure ulcer cases were also collected which identify the subtle changes of the wounds and detect patients’ individualized needs for changing position and addressing wound conditions. The AI-based model for predicting changes in pressure ulcers was built to personalize care and enable earlier prevention and prediction that can also help identify best practices in the treatment of the ulcer. This model can also provide evidence for healthcare professionals in developing guidelines about which treatments are optimal for a comparable type of ulcer. Moreover, this case study will also help improve the quality of patient care, reducing healthcare costs related to complications and minimizing the financial burden. Building an AI-based pressure ulcer model is also beneficial in promoting the application of AI in healthcare-related industries, reducing costs and improving the quality of care. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Connie White Delaney, Charlotte A.

One technique for improving AI safety in high-stakes settings is adversarial training, which uses an adversary to generate examples to train on in order to achieve better worst-case performance. In this work, we used a safe language generation task (“avoid injuries”) as a testbed for achieving high reliability through adversarial training. We created a series of adversarial training techniques-including a tool that assists human adversaries-to find and eliminate failures in a classifier that filters text completions suggested by a generator. In our task, we determined that we can set very conservative classifier thresholds without significantly impacting the quality of the filtered outputs. We found that adversarial training increased robustness to the adversarial attacks that we trained on-doubling the time for our contractors to find adversarial examples both with our tool (from 13 to 26 minutes) and without (from 20 to 44 minutes)-without affecting in-distribution performance. We hope to see further work in the high-stakes reliability setting, including more powerful tools for enhancing human adversaries and better ways to measure high levels of reliability, until we can confidently rule out the possibility of catastrophic deployment-time failures of powerful models. © 2022 Neural information processing systems foundation.

AI can benefit various stages of real estate development, from planning and construction to occupation and demolition. However, Hong Kong’s legal system is currently behind when it comes to technological abilities, while the field of AI safety in built environments is still in its infancy. Negligent design and production processes, irresponsible data management, questionable deployment, algorithm training, sensor design and/or manufacture, unforeseen consequences from multiple data inputs, and erroneous AI operation based on sensor or remote data can all lead to accidents. Yet, determining how legal rules should apply to liability for losses caused by AI systems takes time. Traditional product liability laws can apply for some systems, meaning that the manufacturer will bear responsibility for a malfunctioning part. That said, more complex cases will undoubtedly have to come before the courts to determine whether something unsafe should be the manufacturer’s fault or the individual’s fault, as well as who should receive the subsequent financial and/or non-financial compensation, etc. Since AI adoption has an inevitable relationship with safety concerns, this project intends to shed light on responsible AI development and usage, with a specific focus on AI safety laws, policies, and people’s perceptions. We will conduct a systematic literature review via the PRISMA approach to study the academic perspectives of AI safety policies and laws and data-mining publicly available content on social media platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit to study societal concerns about AI safety in built environments. We will then research court cases and laws related to AI safety in 61 jurisdictions, in addition to policies that have been implemented globally. Two case studies on AI suppliers that sell AI hardware and software to users of built environment will also be included. Another two case studies will be conducted on built environment companies (a contractor and Hong Kong International Airport) that use AI safety tools. The results obtained from social media, court cases, legislation, and policies will be discussed with local and international experts via a workshop, then released to the public to provide the international community and Hong Kong with unique policy and legal orientations. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.","2-s2.0-85146218810"

Public procurement particularly suffers of poor digitalization with ineffective processes and low adoption of Green Public Procurement (GPP) mainly due to the lack of digital and automated data-driven tools for tender evaluation. Leveraging DTs as virtual Prototypes (DTPs) could help to overcome the current discrete project performances evaluation and enable a systemic one, exploitable for bids evaluation besides performance and sustainability optimization. The research adopts a PLM view to define a methodology aimed at developing DTPs starting from the bidding BIM models. The main objective is to integrate several DTPs and an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system in the aim automatizing MEAT (Most Economic Advantageous Tender) procedure and promote GPP adoption, providing an optimal and more objective data-driven awarding system and criteria weighting. Three crucial objectives should be accomplished: (i) the definition of a replicable methodology to develop the DTPs, (ii) the definition of their informative structure and (iii) the re-engineering of tender processes to bring full digitalization and automation. This could enable more effective decisions and performance optimization, bids objective evaluation, tendering procedure streamlining, transparency and sustainability enhancement.

An estimated 1.5-2 million patients in Europe alone suffer from acute or chronic wounds at a given time. The mental and societal burden of living with a chronic wound is immense. Many studies have shown that treatment of these wounds conservatively (without surgery) is one of the major contributing factors to the cost, with wound dressings being a significant impactr. Data from the NHS shows that managing wounds properly such as choosing the appropriate dressing for the right wound and continuous appropriate treatment can significantly increase healing and reduce healthcare spending. Funded by the National Institute of Health Research and NHS England the AI in Health and Care Award Accelerated Access Collaborative (AAC) and NHS AI Lab supported AI technologies across the spectrum of development, from initial feasibility to evaluation within clinical pathways in the NHS and social care settings, to the point that they could be nationally commissioned. In this paper, the findings of a phase 1, project a feasibility study are introduced for discussion and shared learning about an artificial intelligence-based technology which aims in phase 2 to predict the development of hard to heal wounds and their rates of healing and produce recommendations for clinicians dealing with wound care. Woubot® will evaluate the risks of different wound treatments and predict and monitor the progression of wounds. Considering national guidelines on treatment as well as data available, improvements in practice will be recommended, and tailored treatment plans will be suggested for individual patients. Early analysis of patient data (combined electronic clinical records containing demographic, historical, laboratory tests, intervention details etc.) was completed over a 12-month period. The impact of biological factors affecting wound healing suggested that changes in clinical practice such as carrying out a blood test to detect for example vitamin B12 levels and other circulatory factors could significantly improve wound healing rates. The findings suggest that once detected either simple lifestyle changes (diet) or a clinical intervention e.g., B12 injections may result in improved healing. Initial assessments show the monetized benefits of using Woubot® have been predicted to be around £35 million over a period of 10 years, which is a substantial development in the future of wound management. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

The Draft AI Act contains a uniform set of horizontal rules for the development, marketing, and use of AI systems in conformity with the Union values, applying the proportionate risk-based approach. The aim is to avoid regulatory friction and fragmentation and to create a well-functioning internal market for AI systems and technologies. However, the policy and regulatory choices should not obstruct the innovative potential and transformative impact of AI systems and technologies on the society and economy. The Draft AI Act, therefore, introduces AI regulatory sand-boxes, as a testing ground for deciding what to regulate and how. This is a novel regulatory approach, fostering innovation, development, and testing of AI systems under strict regulatory oversight before these systems are placed on the market. The proposed solution from the Draft AI Act has caused both excitement and criticism in the legal doctrine and industry. This paper will explore the benefits and challenges of AI regulatory sandboxes. The draft provisions will be critically evaluated, drawing from the ex-perience in the FinTech industry, especially considering the effect on SMEs. The EU’s ambition is to set up a robust and disruption-resilient, yet flexible, innovation-friendly, and future-proof regulatory framework for AI, and the intuitive appeal of AI regulatory sandboxes for both regulators and innovators deserves an in-depth examination. © 2022, University of Zagreb Faculty of Economics and Business.

GPT-2, a language model, can generate coherent paragraphs independently, without any input on what to write about or guidance on grammar rules. Although multiple pre-trained GPT-2 models exist for English and other high-resource languages, there are few to no such models for Indic languages like Kannada.

It offers two specific reasons for this claim: Human intelligence is a capability of a complex dynamic system-the human brain and central nervous system. Systems of this sort cannot be modelled mathematically in a way that allows them to operate inside a computer. In supporting their claim, the authors, Jobst Landgrebe and Barry Smith, marshal evidence from mathematics, physics, computer science, philosophy, linguistics, and biology, setting up their book around three central questions: What are the essential marks of human intelligence? What is it that researchers try to do when they attempt to achieve ""artificial intelligence"" (AI)? And why, after more than 50 years, are our most common interactions with AI, for example with our bank's computers, still so unsatisfactory? Landgrebe and Smith show how a widespread fear about AI's potential to bring about radical changes in the nature of human beings and in the human social order is founded on an error. There is still, as they demonstrate in a final chapter, a great deal that AI can achieve which will benefit humanity. But these benefits will be achieved without the aid of systems that are more powerful than humans, which are as impossible as AI systems that are intrinsically ""evil"" or able to ""will"" a takeover of human society. © 2023 Jobst Landgrebe and Barry Smith.","2-s2.0-85145119554"

Most often, its application concentrates on supervised machine learning problems such as classification and regression. Nevertheless, in the case of unsupervised algorithms like clustering, XAI can also bring satisfactory results. In most cases, such application is based on the transformation of an unsupervised clustering task into a supervised one and providing generalised global explanations or local explanations based on cluster centroids. However, in many cases, the global explanations are too coarse, while the centroid-based local explanations lose information about cluster shape and distribution. In this paper, we present a novel approach called ClAMP (Cluster Analysis with Multidimensional Prototypes) that aids experts in cluster analysis with human-readable rule-based explanations. The developed state-of-the-art explanation mechanism is based on cluster prototypes represented by multidimensional bounding boxes. This allows representing of arbitrary shaped clusters and combines the strengths of local explanations with the generality of global ones. We demonstrate and evaluate the use of our approach in a real-life industrial case study from the domain of steel manufacturing as well as on the benchmark datasets. The explanations generated with ClAMP were more precise than either centroid-based or global ones.  © 2013 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85139414159"

It is important to apply ethical principles to guide the development and usage of AI systems to prevent harms or discrimination through AI algorithms. This has led to various ethical regulations and guidelines being formed at the corporate, national and supra-national level. The EU AI Act classifies the usage of AI in education as 'high-risk' as “such systems may violate the right to education and training as well as the right not to be discriminated against and perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination” [1, p. 26]. However, there has been little attention paid to ethics in AI in Education (AIED) in literature and there is only one existing framework to ethically guide AIED. AIED ethics is complex as it has to combine both general AI ethics and the ethics of educational technology. We aim to create a theoretical framework for AIED, comprising implementation guidelines for developers and organizational users of AI in education. In this paper, an existing draft framework by Holmes et al. is adapted by using insights from literature in the ethics of AI, ethics of educational technology and ethics of AIED. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

In doing so, the concept of opacity remains unexplained. To overcome this issue, we view opacity as a concept whose meaning depends on the context of application, and on the purposes and characteristics of its users.

Current chatbots employ a rule-based approach, basic machine learning algorithms, or a retrieval-based strategy that does not provide humanized outputs, i.e., these chatbots are incapable of producing engaging dialogues. In this paper, we tried to develop a Behavioural chatbot, using modern deep learning techniques like Seq2Seq aiming to develop chatbots to understand humans and make some situation agnostic conversations that remind us of our desirable personalities. This chatbot model was trained on real human conversations extracted out of Hollywood movies, hence the dataset possesses around 2.3 lakh truly organic dialogues. The model was trained with ~4.2 million parameters, 250 epochs and attained an accuracy of 95%. This chatbot is capable of displaying subtle sarcasm and also tries to be funny at times, thanks to the dramatic Hollywood dialogue writers.  © 2022 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85142770960"

In particular, software based on machine learning (ML) are not considered for the realization of safety-relevant behavior. This limits the introduction of suitable safety concepts for autonomous mobile robots and other autonomous machinery, which commonly depend on ML-based functions. We investigated this issue and the way safety standards define safety measures to be implemented against software faults. Functional safety standards use Safety Integrity Levels (SILs) to define which safety measures shall be implemented. They provide rules for determining the SIL and rules for selecting safety measures depending on the SIL. In this paper, we argue that this approach can hardly be adopted with respect to ML and other kinds of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Instead of simple rules for determining an SIL and applying related measures against faults, we propose the use of assurance cases to argue that the individually selected and applied measures are sufficient in the given case. To get a first rating regarding the feasibility and usefulness of our proposal, we presented and discussed it in a workshop with experts from industry, German statutory accident insurance companies, work safety and standardization commissions, and representatives from various national, European, and international working groups dealing with safety and AI.

This methodology includes a set of guidelines and recommendations whose goal is to present clear and easily understood documents. Such guidelines are used in the manual processes of (a) adapting existing documents and (b) producing new materials. These processes are very time and human-resource consuming, due to the need of involving E2R experts as well as people with cognitive disabilities.

The main goal of this research is to help E2R experts in their daily tasks of (a) assessing a particular document with respect to the E2R guidelines and (b) transforming such a document according to the E2R methodology.

Using artificial intelligence (AI) for anomaly detection to thwart cyber attacks is promising but suffers from generating false alarms and making decisions that are hard to interpret. Consequently, this issue leads to uncertainty and distrust towards such IDS design unless it can explain its behavior, e.g., by using eXplainable AI (XAI). In this paper, we consider the XAI-powered design of such an IV-IDS using CAN bus data from a public dataset, named 'Survival'. Novel features are engineered, and a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is trained over the dataset. A visualization-based explanation, 'VisExp', is created to explain the behavior of the AI-based IV-IDS, which is evaluated by experts in a survey, in relation to a rule-based explanation. Our results show that experts' trust in the AI-based IV-IDS is significantly increased when they are provided with VisExp (more so than the rule-based explanation). These findings confirm the effect, and by extension the need, of explainability in automated systems, and VisExp, being a source of increased explainability, shows promise in helping involved parties gain trust in such systems.  © 2013 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85139441364"

This process is often very cumbersome and mentally exhaustive for intelligence analysts when dealing with a large volume of dynamic all-source intelligence. Consequently, more human time and resources are spent on processing and digesting raw data, instead of strategizing and designing the most effective ISR collection plans. These problems could be amplified significantly in potential future conflicts with a near-peer adversary because the complexity, scale, and intensity of an airborne ISR operation could be several orders higher. This paper discusses our new research concepts and preliminary results in applying artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as proof-of-concepts for facilitating future ISR collection planning and management. We explored a dynamic knowledge graph to represent historical and current all-source intelligence data as well as the corresponding contextual relationships and temporal states. Such an accumulative knowledge base allows us to apply machine learning and other analytical methods to infer and visualize multi-layered intelligence on an adversary’s capabilities and operations. These analytical results could assist human ISR analysts in understanding adversary’s operational tactics, techniques, and procedures. We further look into AI-enabled virtual agents in assisting mission planners to best manage a group of ISR assets for fulfillment of collection requirements. Applying deep reinforcement learning to Intellection, a new cooperative multi-player ISR collection board game, we train the virtual agents into AI players who can follow the game rules and estimate the desirable flight paths for potentially maximizing successful collections over prioritized targets. Together, these explorations may potentially create decision advantages and relieve possible manpower bottlenecks in future fast-paced ISR collection planning and management. © 2022 SPIE.","2-s2.0-85146597282"

Experience has shown, though, that mariners sometimes, based on good seamanship, make situational adaptations where they deviate from the steering rules in the COLREG. Their goal may be to improve efficiency in own operations or simply due to courtesy of a perhaps less maneuverable approaching ship. In this paper an analysis has been performed to characterize the situations when such deviations typically occur and to estimate the conditional probability of such deviations, given the respective situation. Furthermore, the paper proposes a design for how an artificial intelligence (AI) system may handle these situations through an Extended Timeframe for AI Decision (ETAD). We suggest that the AI system search through the available clusters of situations before it normally would suggest an evasive maneuver. If the identified situation is similar to situations where the probability of an approaching ship deviating the COLREG and give way is significant, the AI could be given an extended timeframe, await its maneuver, and thereby improve the efficiency of the operation without jeopardizing the safety. © 2022","2-s2.0-85142770606"

This research was conducted to develop an AI-based system which focuses on education and monitoring with regard to danger signs during pregnancy using NLP. The Telegram chatbot was used to develop the system after investigating user needs based on the danger sign monitoring guideline from WHO and the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia. The inputs from users were recognized by NLP and forwarded to the testing data for decision system. Furthermore, the analysis result was sent to the user which provides educational information and a personalized monitoring result.

Former research demonstrates the remarkable accuracy of AI to aid physicians to settle on better clinical choices or supplant judgment made by human beings, in particular, technical and practical areas of medical care. Statistics indicate that the shortage of doctors in therapeutically under-resourced regions and the lack of availability of skilled physicians in highly engaged clinical settings tend to cause a rise in false detection rates. The excessive workload causes fatigue that could lead to poor recovery of diseases. AI is ever-evolving as it is making advancements at an exponential rate, especially in healthcare treatments, such as monitoring treatments, improving the planning, and analyzing data to provide better treatment plans. The procedure of data accumulation, data management, clustering, and tagging invites numerous governance and regulatory challenges that could take a long duration. The healthcare industry thrives in this unending battle as the complexity and intricacy of data, and strict guidelines take a major toll. A healthcare institute is subjected to ask for consent from an institutional review board’s work to attenuate a portion of these concerns, and researchers and scientists may measure, process, and anonymize DICOM information to strip away any patient’s medical information. The AI-enabled medical care employed in the institutes plays an imperative role as an informative assistant that provides aid to doctors in acquiring an understanding of meaningful patterns from data collection. This practice holds the potential to save a lot of time, cost, and effort while yielding consistent, unbiased, and prime diagnosis or treatment. AI and deep learning (DL) tools used in day-to-day medical decision-making have a grave impact on improving the patient’s treatment and overall cost incurred due to their employment efficiency and accuracy. AI and machine learning (ML) can prove to be of supreme importance and assistance in the early detection and thus the prevention of a plethora of diseases by reading and analyzing the patient’s vitals. The presented chapter is of 5-folds. First, the distinct data sources where the healthcare data is gathered from are discussed. Second, we talk about the moral and lawful difficulties of AI-driven medical care. Next, the structured and unstructured types of healthcare data have been analyzed followed by the AI techniques applied to these types of data, such as ML, natural language processing (NLP), and DL.We then analyze the crucial disease areas such as cardiology, radiology, neurology, and cancer, where the health issues can be alleviated by employing AI techniques. In conclusion, we further discuss the areas where AI-based techniques are applied in real life. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2022.","2-s2.0-85142557463"

In this implementation, we have used RDR to develop an improving and increasing knowledge base of classification rules for assigning rhetorical role labels to the sentences in a legal document. The RDR rules for classification are developed using a set of syntactic, semantic and statistical features at word, sentence and document level. For each sentence in the legal document we have assigned an rhetorical role with the help of Ripple Down Rule. We have generated the final summary using the identified thirteen rhetorical roles. The proposed system is evaluated using 50 legal documents from four different domains. Experiments demonstrate that the RDR based Legal Document summarization approach has advantages over supervised and unsupervised ML techniques such as, independence from the need of annotated dataset and continuous updation of classification rules for rhetorical role labeling with the help of expert knowledge. © 2022 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85164251817"

The development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) systems to perform a wide variety of tasks has raised new questions about how AI may affect human autonomy. Numerous guidelines on the responsible development of AI now emphasise the need for human autonomy to be protected. In some cases, this need is linked to the emergence of increasingly ‘autonomous’ AI systems that can perform tasks without human control or supervision. Do such ‘autonomous’ systems pose a risk to our own human autonomy? In this article, I address the question of a trade-off between human autonomy and system ‘autonomy’. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85142445478"

Furthermore, the ideas about the meaning of such an addition in relation to the administration differ. By means of legal regulations, administration digitalisation is to be advanced more strongly. According to the Act of Online Access to Administration Services enacted based on Art. 91c (5) Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (= GG), the Federation and the Federal states must also offer their administrative services by means of information technology by the end of 2022 at the latest via administrative portals that are linked to each other to form a portal network (cf. § 1 OZG). The Federation’s and the Federal states’ administrative procedure acts and e-government acts contain regulations on electronic administration that even enable administrations to handle procedures completely electronically. Recently, there have been general regulations on the fully automated issuing of administrative acts if these are authorised by legal regulation (e.g. internet-based motor vehicle registration). In view of the currently limited capacity of IT systems, § 35a Administrative Procedure Act (= VwVfG) warns that decisions where an authority is authorised to use its discretion (Ermessen) or prerogative of assessment (Beurteilungsspielraum) are not suitable for fully automated administrative decisions. In view of the autonomy of AI systems, their use raises particular problems on the part of the administration in terms of democracy and the rule of law. In addition, legal requirements are increasingly imposed to enable the opening of data stock for innovative uses. Since the principle of limited file publicity prevailed in Germany for a long time, a certain restraint can be noted in this area. Here and in other areas, however, union law continues to drive e-government forward. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022.","2-s2.0-85160754246"

We show how the Interpretation Problem in Artificial Intelligence is an illustration of Wittgenstein’s general claim that no rule can contain the criteria for its own application, and that the risks created by this problem escalates in proportion to the degree to which a machine is causally connected to the world, in what we call the Law of Interpretative Exposure. Using games as an illustration, we attempt to define the structure of normative spaces and argue that any rule-following within a normative space is guided by values that are external to that space and which cannot themselves be represented as rules. In light of this, we categorise the types of mistakes an artificial moral agent could make into Mistakes of Intention and Instrumental Mistakes, and we propose ways of building morality into machines by getting them to interpret the rules we give in accordance with these external values, through explicit moral reasoning, the “Show, not Tell” paradigm, the adjustment of causal power and structure of the agent, and relational values, with the ultimate aim that the machine develop a virtuous character and that the impact of the Interpretation Problem is minimised. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85144815494"

For this purpose, a Systematic Literature Review comprising 5090 peer-reviewed references relating safety to AI has been carried out, with focus on a 329-reference subset in which the safety assurance of AI-based systems is directly conveyed. From 2016 onwards, the safety assurance of AI-based systems has experienced significant effervescence and leaned towards five main approaches: performing black-box testing, using safety envelopes, designing fail-safe AI, combining white-box analyses with explainable AI, and establishing a safety assurance process throughout systems' lifecycles. Each of these approaches has been discussed in this paper, along with their features, pros and cons. Finally, guidelines for future research topics have also been presented. They result from an analysis based on both the cross-fertilization among the reviewed references and the authors' experience with safety and AI. Among 15 research themes, these guidelines reinforce the need for deepening guidelines for the safety assurance of AI-based systems by, e.g., analyzing datasets from a safety perspective, designing explainable AI, setting and justifying AI hyperparameters, and assuring the safety of hardware-implemented AI-based systems.  © 2013 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85144813199"

Therefore, one must define combat tactics, doctrines, rules of engagement, and concepts of operation. Reinforcement learning has been proven to generate a broad range of tactical actions within the behavioral boundaries of the involved entities. In a multi-agent ground combat scenario, this paper demonstrates how our artificial intelligence (AI) application develops strategies and provides orders to subsidiary units while conducting missions accordingly. We propose a combined approach where human knowledge and responsibility collaborate with an AI system. To communicate on a common level, the orders and actions imposed by AI are given in natural language. This empowers the human operator to act in a human-on-the-loop role in order to validate and evaluate the reasoning of AI.

The ethical impact of AI has been recognized as a social issue, and countries and organizations have formulated principles and guidelines on AI ethics, and laws and regulations will be enforced in Europe. Because these principles and guidelines are written in terms of philosophy and law, AI service providers, developers, and business users have the challenge of how they should practice the principles and guidelines to their AI systems. To address this challenge, we first analyzed cases of ethical problems caused by AI in the past and assumed that ethical problems could be linked to interactions between components of AI systems and stakeholders related to such systems. On the basis of this assumption, we then developed a methodology to comprehensively extract the ethical risks that an AI system poses. This methodology consists of two approaches. The first approach is to develop an AI ethics model that embodies ethics guidelines as necessary requirements for ethical AI systems and correlates these requirements with interactions. The second approach is an impact assessment process that uses the AI ethics models to extract ethical risks for individual AI systems. In this paper, we discuss the details of this methodology and show the results of an initial validation to verify the above assumption and the ease of the impact assessment process. © 2022 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85142257709"

Blockchains can guarantee the accessibility and consistent admittance to integrity safeguarded big data indexes from numerous areas, allowing AI systems to learn more effectively and thoroughly. Similarly, artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to offer new consensus processes, and hence new methods of engaging with Blockchains. When it comes to sensitive data, such as corporate, healthcare, and financial data, various security and privacy problems arise that must be properly evaluated. Interaction with Blockchains is vulnerable to data credibility checks, transactional data leakages, data protection rules compliance, on-chain data privacy, and malicious smart contracts. To solve these issues, new security and privacy-preserving technologies are being developed.

Ambiguity also makes it impossible to assign responsibility and control potential AI biases. Thus, international and national standards were set to counteract the negative consequences, among the most important international standards are the recommendations set by UNESCO for the ethics of artificial intelligence. While on the United Arab Emirates Level, this study addresses the basis of this explanation right in its Constitution, in the Civil Procedures Law and Smart Dubai Department Law No. (1) of 2020, which was enacted in order to enhance the status of the Emirate of Dubai and support its efforts towards transformation into smart cities. The authors relied on an analytical and descriptive approach to the various legislative provisions related to the right to explain. The study concluded that there is no explicit legal provision at the UAE level that establishes the right of people to have AI decisions explained. However, this right has been recognized at the international level in the nonbinding UNESCO guidelines.

However, AI's use in high-value, sensitive, or safety-critical applications such as self-management for personalized health or personalized nutrition has been challenging. These require that the AI system follows guidelines or well-defined processes set by experts, community, or standards. We characterize these as process knowledge (PK). For example, to diagnose the severity of depression, the AI system should incorporate PK that is part of the clinical decision-making process, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Likewise, a nutritionist's knowledge and dietary guidelines are needed to create food plans for diabetic patients. Furthermore, the BlackBox nature of purely data-reliant statistical AI systems falls short in providing user-understandable explanations, such as what a clinician would need to ensure and document compliance with medical guidelines before relying on a recommendation. Using the examples of mental health and cooking recipes for diabetic patients, we show why, what, and how to incorporate PK along with domain knowledge in machine learning.

Although the matter of civil liability has been the subject of many studies and resolutions, multiple attempts to harmonize EU tort law have been unsuccessful so far, and only the liability of producers for defective products has been harmonized so far. In 2021, by publishing the AI Act proposal, the European Commission reached the goal to regulate AI at the European level, classifying smart robots as”high-risk systems”. This new piece of legislation, albeit tackling important issues, does not focus on liability rules. However, regulating the responsibility of developers and manufacturers of robots and AI systems, in order to avoid a fragmented legal framework across the EU and an uneven application of liability rules in each Member State, is still an important issue that raises many concerns in the industry sector. In particular, deep learning techniques need to be carefully regulated, as they challenge the traditional liability paradigm: it is often not possible to know the reason behind the output given by those models, and neither the programmer nor the manufacturer is able to predict the AI behavior. For this reason, some authors have argued that we need to take liability away from producers and programmers when robots are capable of acting autonomously from their original design, while others have proposed a strict liability regime. This article explores liability issues about AI and robots with regards to users, producers, and programmers, especially when the use of machine learning techniques is involved, and suggests some regulatory solutions for European lawmakers. © 2022 Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, ECIAIR 2022","2-s2.0-85176323315"

Once it is diagnosed, it cannot be cured definitively. Continuous attention needs to be given to such patients in both hospital and home environment. Due to the lack of measurement and risk analysis at home, the chance of early intervention is dramatically reduced. This research aims to offer a hybrid AI-based approach for patients to monitor and assess their daily risk at home. Highly personalized AI models are trained with continuous data stream from wearable devices and demographic information. The personalized risk assessment is based on individual's benchmark of the daily routine and bio pattern. Also, the rule-based algorithms are developed based on clinical well-established thresholds. This hybrid approach yields 87.5% accuracy. Our approach can provide a cost-efficient method for at-home patients' heart failure prediction. © 2022 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85143176996"

Most policymakers, however, lack the technical knowledge to judge whether an emerging AI technology is safe, effective and requires oversight, therefore depending on experts opinion. But policymakers are better served when, in addition to expert opinion, they have some general understanding of existing guidelines and regulations.While not comprehensive, this work provides an overview of AI legislation and directives at the international, U.S. state and federal levels.

Through Machine Learning these AI systems automatically learn and adapt themselves so that they can offer an even more accurate outcome than humans and this offers many exciting benefits to most businesses and economies. But their introduction has raised ethical questions after some unethical conduct on their part like racism, biasness against women, unemployment (through intelligent automation), and inequality. After these incidents of unethical behaviour by some AI technologies around the globe most public, private, and even non-profit organisations embarked on initiatives to address the unethical conduct of AI systems. They produced a range of ethical AI frameworks, guidelines, and principles, but a properly balanced AI, where opportunity, ethics, and opportunity costs intersect, is still to be achieved or realised. Most AI Practitioners are pressured by their shareholders to prioritise commercial interests over ethical considerations.

AI benchmarks for visual reasoning have driven rapid progress in recent years with state-of-the-art systems now reaching human accuracy on some of these benchmarks. Yet, there remains a major gap between humans and AI systems in terms of the sample efficiency with which they learn new visual reasoning tasks. Humans' remarkable efficiency at learning has been at least partially attributed to their ability to harness compositionality - allowing them to efficiently take advantage of previously gained knowledge when learning new tasks. Here, we introduce a novel visual reasoning benchmark, Compositional Visual Relations (CVR), to drive progress towards the development of more data-efficient learning algorithms. We take inspiration from fluid intelligence and non-verbal reasoning tests and describe a novel method for creating compositions of abstract rules and generating image datasets corresponding to these rules at scale. Our proposed benchmark includes measures of sample efficiency, generalization, compositionality, and transfer across task rules. We systematically evaluate modern neural architectures and find that convolutional architectures surpass transformer-based architectures across all performance measures in most data regimes. However, all computational models are much less data efficient than humans, even after learning informative visual representations using self-supervision. Overall, we hope our challenge will spur interest in developing neural architectures that can learn to harness compositionality for more efficient learning. © 2022 Neural information processing systems foundation.

Early detection of resectable/curable esophageal cancers has a great potential to reduce mortality, but no guideline-recommended screening test is available. Although some screening methods have been developed, they are expensive, might be difficult to apply to the general population, and often fail to achieve satisfactory sensitivity for identifying early-stage cancers. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of esophageal tumor detection and classification (cancer or benign) on the noncontrast CT scan, which could potentially be used for opportunistic cancer screening. To capture the global context, a novel position-sensitive self-attention is proposed to augment nnUNet with non-local interactions. Our model achieves a sensitivity of 93.0% and specificity of 97.5% for the detection of esophageal tumors on a holdout testing set with 180 patients. In comparison, the mean sensitivity and specificity of four doctors are 75.0% and 83.8%, respectively. For the classification task, our model outperforms the mean doctors by absolute margins of 17%, 31%, and 14% for cancer, benign tumor, and normal, respectively. Compared with established state-of-the-art esophageal cancer screening methods, e.g., blood testing and endoscopy AI system, our method has comparable performance and is even more sensitive for early-stage cancer and benign tumor. Our proposed method is a novel, non-invasive, low-cost, and highly accurate tool for opportunistic screening of esophageal cancer. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85139054911"

The main argument set forth is that a relational rationale, requiring a broader range of actors in the supply chain to share legal responsibility for Data Protection by Design (DPbD) is better suited to address infringements to these fundamental rights than the current model that assigns responsibility mainly to the data controller or data processor. Reconceptualizing the law in a more future-oriented, relational, and distributed way would make it possible to adapt legal rules – including those within the GDPR and the continuously evolving EU acquis – to the complex reality of technology development, at least partly addressing the responsibility gap in DPbD. A future-oriented conception of responsibility would require technology providers to adopt more proactive approaches to DPbD, even where they are unlikely to qualify as a controller. A relational approach to DPbD would require technology providers to bear greater responsibilities to those individuals or groups that are affected by their design choices. A distributed approach to DPbD would allow for downstream actors in the supply chain to bear part of the legal responsibility for DPbD by relying on legal requirements that are applicable to various actors in the supply chain supporting DPbD such as those found in contract law, liability law, and the emerging EU acquis governing AI, data, and information security. © 2022 The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85151292444"

Within just a few decades, the private sector has seen a wild proliferation of AI systems, many of which are more powerful and penetrating than anticipated. In many cases, AI systems have become “the power behind the throne,” tracking user activities and making fateful decisions through predictive analysis of personal information. Despite the growing power of AI, proprietary algorithmic systems can be technically complex, legally claimed as trade secrets, and managerially invisible to outsiders, creating an opacity that hinders oversight of AI systems. Accordingly, many AI-based services and products have been found to be invasive, manipulative, and biased, eroding data privacy rules, human rights, and democratic norms in modern society. The emergence of AI systems has thus generated a deep tension between algorithmic secrecy and data privacy. Yet, in today’s policy debate, algorithmic transparency in a privacy context is an equally important issue that is nonetheless managerially disregarded, commercially evasive, and legally unactualized. This Note is the first to illustrate how regulators should rethink strategies regarding data privacy through the interplay of human rights, algorithmic disclosures, and whistleblowing systems. As the world increasingly looks to the European Union’s (EU) data protection law—the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)—as a regulatory frame of reference, this piece assesses the effectiveness of the GDPR’s response to data protection issues raised by opaque AI systems. Based on a case study of Google’s AI applications and privacy disclosures, this piece demonstrates that even the EU fails to enforce data protection rules to address issues caused by algorithmic opacity. This Note argues that as algorithmic opacity has become a primary barrier to oversight and enforcement, regulators in the EU, the United States, and elsewhere should not overprotect the secrecy of every aspect of AI applications that implicate public concerns. Rather, policymakers should consider imposing a duty of algorithmic disclosures through sustainability reporting and whistleblower protection on firms deploying AI to maximize effective enforcement of data privacy laws, human rights, and other democratic values.

While data-driven FDD methods nowadays outperform the majority of traditional FDD approaches, such as the physically based models and mathematically based models, in terms of both efficiency and accuracy, the interpretability of those methods does not grow significantly. Instead, according to the literature survey, the interpretability of the data-driven FDD methods becomes the main concern and creates barriers for those methods to be adopted in real-world industrial applications. In this study, we reviewed the existing data-driven FDD approaches for building mechanical & electrical engineering (M&E) services faults and discussed the interpretability of the modern data-driven FDD methods. Two data-driven FDD strategies integrating the expert reasoning of the faults were proposed.

The study mainly focuses on (1) the development and use of AI systems/projects reported by companies, (2) the extent to which companies disclose ethical principles or guidelines regarding AI and (3) the factors explaining these practices. The study analyses the reports of 200 companies listed in the major indexes of Germany, Sweden, Finland, France, Spain, and Italy, both from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. All reports are analysed, using content analysis methodology, to identify expressions such as ‘artificial intelligence’, ‘machine learning’, ‘deep learning’, and ‘big data’, and then classified accordingly. The study's findings suggest a growing interest in the above-mentioned technologies, although 41.5% of companies do not report any activity in the field of AI. The adoption of ethical approaches to AI is at a very preliminary stage, and<5% of companies report on that issue. The quantitative analysis shows that larger companies, companies in the Technology and Telecommunications industries, and companies based in Southern countries are more likely to disclose information on AI activity. The majority of companies that develop ethical principles are listed in the Northern region and belong to the Technology and Telecommunications industries. The study provides evidence of AI disclosure, a type of non-financial disclosure that has not been explored yet in the literature. Unlike existing studies, we propose a first definition of the topic and a taxonomy that can be used in further research on AI disclosure and can contribute to the development of KPIs in the field. Furthermore, this study provides a theoretical framework integrating some traditional theories, such as Voluntary disclosure theory, Signalling theory, and Legitimacy theory, specifically drawn to interpret AI disclosure practices, which can help with a further in-depth exploration of AI disclosure combining concurrent perspectives. The study's results may serve as a starting point for researchers and companies interested in the topic. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","2-s2.0-85116053592"

Early stage clinical evaluation is important to assess an AI system's actual clinical performance at small scale, ensure its safety, evaluate the human factors surrounding its use, and pave the way to further large scale trials. However, the reporting of these early studies remains inadequate. The present statement provides a multistakeholder, consensus-based reporting guideline for the Developmental and Exploratory Clinical Investigations of DEcision support systems driven by Artificial Intelligence (DECIDE-AI). We conducted a two round, modified Delphi process to collect and analyse expert opinion on the reporting of early clinical evaluation of AI systems. Experts were recruited from 20 predefined stakeholder categories. The final composition and wording of the guideline was determined at a virtual consensus meeting. The checklist and the Explanation and Elaboration (EandE)sections were refined based on feedback from a qualitative evaluation process. 123 experts participated in the first round of Delphi, 138 in the second, 16 in the consensus meeting, and 16 in the qualitative evaluation. The DECIDE-AI reporting guideline comprises 17 AI specific reporting items (made of 28 subitems) and 10 generic reporting items, with an E and E paragraph provided for each. Through consultation and consensus with a range of stakeholders, we have developed a guideline comprising key items that should be reported in early stage clinical studies of AI-based decision support systems in healthcare. By providing an actionable checklist of minimal reporting items, the DECIDE-AI guideline will facilitate the appraisal of these studies and replicability of their findings.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

At present, in different fields, people provide protection for online data migration through the way of project management to ensure the speed and efficiency of online migration. However, some problems may occur in the process of online data migration. In the development of contemporary sports, competitive sports, as the high-end stage of sports development, are constantly pursued by ordinary sports enthusiasts. Therefore, in the national fitness activities, how to combine the national fitness and competitive sports data to provide a more professional storage platform is a focus of research but also a problem to be solved in the process of online data migration. Because the data mining ID3 algorithm only supports querying and retrieving RowKey indexes, it does not support non-RowKey column indexing. Therefore, if you want to query non-RowKey indexes, the data mining ID3 algorithm will search the form in the overall scan, but the performance of this method is low. In order to improve the query speed of non-RowKey columns, this paper designs a secondary index function based on HBase. The sports competition action system can retrieve data from the secondary index of the query state, to avoid scanning the whole world and improve the search speed. In this paper, ID3 algorithm is used to combine national fitness and competitive sports data, which provides a guarantee for the migration of competitive sports data in the national fitness system. © 2022 Jianmin Xiang et al.","2-s2.0-85138656845"

We have deployed TADK in commodity WAF and 5G UPF, and the evaluation result shows that TADK can achieve a throughput up to 35.3Gbps per core on traffic feature extraction, 6.5Gbps per core on traffic classification, and can decrease SQLi/XSS detection down to 4.5μs per request with higher accuracy than fixed pattern solution.  © 2022 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85135237223"

This poses challenges under the current framework of laws, regulations, and ethical guidelines applicable to health care in South Africa. The article outlines these challenges and sets out guiding principles for a normative framework to regulate the use of AI in health care. The article examines three key areas for legal reform in relation to AI in health care. First, it proposes that the regulatory framework for the oversight of software as a medical device needs to be updated to develop frameworks for adequately regulating the use of such new technologies. Secondly, it argues that the present HPCSA guidelines for health care practitioners in South Africa adopt an unduly restrictive approach centred in the outmoded semantics of telemedicine. This may discourage technological innovation that could improve access to health care for all, and as such the guidelines are inconsistent with the national digital health strategy. Thirdly, it examines the common law principles of fault-based liability for medical negligence, which could prove inadequate to provide patients and users of new technologies with redress for harm where fault cannot clearly be attributed to the healthcare practitioner. It argues that consideration should be given to developing a statutory scheme for strict liability, together with mandatory insurance, and appropriate reform of product liability pertaining to technology developers and manufacturers. These legal reforms should not be undertaken without also developing a coherent, human-rights centred policy framework for the ethical use of AI, robotics, and related technologies in health care in South Africa. © 2022, North-West Unversity.","2-s2.0-85129907028"

Deep neural networks have shown the same or better performance than clinicians in many tasks owing to the rapid increase in the available data and computational power. In order to conform to the principles of trustworthy AI, it is essential that the AI system be transparent, robust, fair, and ensure accountability. Current deep neural solutions are referred to as black-boxes due to a lack of understanding of the specifics concerning the decision-making process. Therefore, there is a need to ensure the interpretability of deep neural networks before they can be incorporated into the routine clinical workflow. In this narrative review, we utilized systematic keyword searches and domain expertise to identify nine different types of interpretability methods that have been used for understanding deep learning models for medical image analysis applications based on the type of generated explanations and technical similarities. Furthermore, we report the progress made towards evaluating the explanations produced by various interpretability methods.

Stroke diseases can be divided into ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke, and they should be minimized by emergency treatment such as thrombolytic or coagulant administration by type. First, it is essential to detect in real time the precursor symptoms of stroke, which occur differently for each individual, and to provide professional treatment by a medical institution within the proper treatment window. However, prior studies have focused on developing acute treatment or clinical treatment guidelines after the onset of stroke rather than detecting the prognostic symptoms of stroke. In particular, in recent studies, image analysis such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) has mostly been used to detect and predict prognostic symptoms in stroke patients. Not only are these methodologies difficult to diagnose early in real-time, but they also have limitations in terms of a long test time and a high cost of testing. In this paper, we propose a system that can predict and semantically interpret stroke prognostic symptoms based on machine learning using the multi-modal bio-signals of electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) measured in real-time for the elderly. To predict stroke disease in real-time while walking, we designed and implemented a stroke disease prediction system with an ensemble structure that combines CNN and LSTM. The proposed system considers the convenience of wearing the bio-signal sensors for the elderly, and the bio-signals were collected at a sampling rate of 1,000Hz per second from the three electrodes of the ECG and the index finger for PPG while walking. According to the experimental results, C4.5 decision tree showed a prediction accuracy of 91.56% while RandomForest showed a prediction accuracy of 97.51% during walking by the elderly.

AI can have a great impact on the workforce of a project within the construction industry. Use of Machine learning techniques within the project process can be beneficial for a project manager to manage financial aspects and time scheduling both. The major problem that construction project managers face is ineffective tracking process, cost management process. This is the main reason, the AI-based solution are needed within construction sites. The aim of this research is to identify the role of AI in time management as well as cost management of a construction project in India. Intelligence robotics is a major AI-based tool that is used within construction project for marinating cost. Some challenges are also found within construction project that might have a huge effect within its implementation process such as cultural barriers, high-cost of maintenance and unavailability of similar input parameters in all projects. As per the findings, ANN, SVM, Regression and many other AI-based are effective Ai-based machine learning tools that are used within construction project to replace various time consuming process by modern technologies. Construction delays are the major effective factor for cost overrun and time overrun within a project. As per this research article, it has been found that, use of AI, especially ANN model can reduce the tendency of delay in construction projects and mismanagement of costs.  © 2022 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85130092685"

Underneath these attempts sits a suite of communication functions to enable effective teaming. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems supporting the teaming arrangement have primarily relied on knowledge-based systems, with rules triggered based on the mode of interaction. Enabling humans to join the team of AI agents effectively calls for both the humans and AI agents to share their understanding and representation of their shared worlds. Such shared understanding requires formal representations of concepts to support transparency during bi-directional communications between team members. Little research has been done in this space, especially when humans need to team with a swarm of agents. We present an ontology designed specifically for human-agent teaming to address this research gap. The ontology is general, but we then contextualise it into a particular swarm-shepherding scenario to illustrate its use in a particular context.

A great example of such systems is AI-enabled adaptive learning systems (AI-ALS) that promote adaptive learning. Despite its promised potential, there are challenges such as design issues, highly complex models, and lack of evidence-based guidelines and design principles that hinder the large-scale adoption and implementation of AI-ALS. The goal of this paper thus is to establish a set of empirically grounded design principles (DPs) of AI-ALS, that would serve well in a university context. 22 interviews were con-ducted with experts knowledgeable about the design and development of AI-ALS. Several rounds of coding and deep analysis of the expert interviews revealed features and functionalities of AI-ALS; purposes for designing and using AI-ALS; and recommended improvements for AI-ALS as requirements. These requirements were translated to 13 preliminary DPs. The findings of this study serve as a guide on how to better design AI-ALS, that will improve the learning experiences of students. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","2-s2.0-85137999557"

In the case of the many AI systems, they use a huge amount of data to train their models as well as the system is very complex for humans to comprehend. Hence, humans cannot be able to understand AI systems and have no confidence in the results they generate.

Our major findings are: (1) the current practice is often a done-once-and-forget type of ethical risk assessment at a particular development step, which is not sufficient for highly uncertain and continual learning AI systems; (2) ethical requirements are either omitted or mostly stated as high-level objectives, and not specified explicitly in verifiable way as system outputs or outcomes; (3) although ethical requirements have the characteristics of cross-cutting quality and non-functional requirements amenable to architecture and design analysis, system-level architecture and design are under-explored; (4) there is a strong desire for continuously monitoring and validating AI systems post deployment for ethical requirements but current operation practices provide limited guidance.

Various AI algorithms are embedded in cooperative fog/edge devices to construct medical Internet of Things environments, infectious disease forecast systems, smart health, and so on. However, these systems are usually done in isolation, which is called single-task learning. They do not consider the correlation and relationship between multiple/different tasks, so some common information in the model parameters or data characteristics is lost. In this study, each data center in fog/edge computing is considered as a task in the multi-task learning framework. In such a learning framework, a multi-task weighted Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system, called MW-TSKFS, is developed to forecast the trend of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MW-TSKFS provides a multi-task learning strategy for both antecedent and consequent parameters of fuzzy rules. First, a multi-task weighted fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is developed for antecedent parameter learning, which extracts the public information among all tasks and the private information of each task. By sharing the public cluster centroid and public membership matrix, the differences of commonality and individuality can be further exploited. For consequent parameter learning of MW-TSKFS, a multi-task collaborative learning mechanism is developed based on ϵ-insensitive criterion and L2 norm penalty term, which can enhance the generalization and forecasting ability of the proposed fuzzy system. The experimental results on the real COVID-19 time series show that the forecasting tend model based on multi-task the weighted TSK fuzzy system has a high application value.  © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","2-s2.0-85137614940"

However, AISE, which is today mainly based on the use of deep learning (DL) neural networks, is still under development. This makes the education of AI software engineers particularly challenging, since there are no well-established methodologies, tools and practices, like in traditional Software Engineering (SE) education drawing on decades of experience and methods in all phases of software development, from requirements analysis over design and implementation to integration and testing. We analyze the main differences between traditional SE and AISE education and address challenges in AISE education. Our methodology is based on literature survey, analysis of own industry experience and statistical analysis of students works on AI applications. Our goal is to provide guidelines for an AISE process and propose a curriculum path for AISE education, which can be used to update a traditional SE curriculum. According to results of our analysis, the main challenges for the students are: Dealing with data and taking into account that algorithms change (learn) by data, selection and re-use of AI algorithms, model test, maintenance and automatizing the AISE process. We propose to address these challenges in SE curricula by teaching more statistical thinking with connections to software development, developing re-engineering capabilities, teaching a model-based AI approach and combining AI with virtual reality simulations. In the whole process, we consider an optimal division of work between humans and AI systems by explicitly including humans in the AISE loop. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85124767420"

The high profile of ‘AI in health’ means that there are unusually strong drivers to accelerate the introduction and implementation of innovative AI interventions, which may not be supported by the available evidence, and for which the usual systems of appraisal may not yet be sufficient. Main text: We are beginning to see the emergence of randomised clinical trials evaluating AI interventions in real-world settings. It is imperative that these studies are conducted and reported to the highest standards to enable effective evaluation because they will potentially be a key part of the evidence that is used when deciding whether an AI intervention is sufficiently safe and effective to be approved and commissioned. Minimum reporting guidelines for clinical trial protocols and reports have been instrumental in improving the quality of clinical trials and promoting completeness and transparency of reporting for the evaluation of new health interventions. The current guidelines—SPIRIT and CONSORT—are suited to traditional health interventions but research has revealed that they do not adequately address potential sources of bias specific to AI systems. Examples of elements that require specific reporting include algorithm version and the procedure for acquiring input data. In response, the SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary group of international experts using a consensus building methodological process. The extensions include a number of new items that should be reported in addition to the core items. Each item, where possible, was informed by challenges identified in existing studies of AI systems in health settings. Conclusion: The SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI guidelines provide the first international standards for clinical trials of AI systems. The guidelines are designed to ensure complete and transparent reporting of clinical trial protocols and reports involving AI interventions and have the potential to improve the quality of these clinical trials through improvements in their design and delivery. Their use will help to efficiently identify the safest and most effective AI interventions and commission them with confidence for the benefit of patients and the public. © 2021, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85098876754"

However, the current practice of documenting design in most industries does not result in big data that can support a true digital transformation of enterprise. Very little information on concepts and decisions in early product design has been digitally captured, and the access and retrieval of them via taxonomy-based knowledge management systems are very challenging because most rule-based classification and search systems cannot concurrently process heterogeneous data (text, figures, tables, references). When experts retire or leave a design unit, industry often cannot benefit from past knowledge for future product design, and is left to reinvent the wheel repeatedly. In this work, we present AI-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) models which are trained for contextually representing technical documents containing texts, figures and tables, to do a semantic search for the retrieval of relevant data across large corpora of documents. By connecting textual and non-textual data through the use of an associative database, the semantic search question-answering system we developed can provide more comprehensive answers in the context of users' questions. For the demonstration and assessment of this model, the semantic search question-answering system is applied to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report 2019, which is more than 600 pages long and difficult to read and understand, even by most experts. Users can input custom queries relating to climate change concerns and receive evidence from the report that is contextually meaningful. We expect this method can transform current repositories of design documentation of heterogeneous data forms into structured knowledge-bases which can return relevant information efficiently as well as can evolve to embody manageable big data for the true digital transformation of design. © 2022 The Authors.","2-s2.0-85133542087"

However, the results of these studies on AI UX design principles are insufficient for actual AI systems. In light of this fact, the purpose of this study was to upgrade the UX design of a defense system that uses AI technology to detect land changes and targets. In order to upgrade the UX design of this AI system, a three-step procedure was executed. First, AI UX principles were derived by analyzing literature related to human-AI interaction. Second, ideation was performed to improve the interface. Finally, the results of the ideation were utilized to construct the UX prototype of the AI system with Adobe XD. The results of this study are expected to be used as fundamental data for future research that will develop UX principles and advanced methods for AI systems. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85127195397"

Some examples such as Amazon's discriminating recruiting algorithm showed that algorithms are not free of unethical decision making. Although there already exists a variety of ethics principles for AI-based systems, those are usually hardly being applicable to specific use cases such as using AI-based algorithms in recruiting processes. To address this issue and to provide guidance for researchers and practitioners, we conducted a systematic literature review (keyword and backwards search) on existing ethics guidelines and principles for AI and extracted aspects that seemed applicable to guide recruiting processed. Based on 28 relevant papers we derived actionable guidelines for using AI-based algorithms in recruiting processes.

However, adoption lacks behind for use cases with regulatory or compliance requirements, as validation and auditing of AI is still unresolved. AI's opaqueness (i.e.,”black box”) makes the validation challenging for auditors. Explainable AI (XAI) is the proposed technical countermeasure that can support validation and auditing of AI. We developed an XAI based validation approach for AI in sensitive use cases that facilitates the understanding of the system's behaviour. We conducted a case study in pharmaceutical manufacturing where strict regulatory requirements are present. The validation approach and an XAI prototype were developed through multiple workshops and then tested and evaluated with interviews. Our approach proved suitable to collect the required evidence for a software validation, but requires additional efforts compared to a traditional software validation.

Under the doctrine of unilateral mistakes, the black box problem renders it impracticable to prove that the non-mistaken party (“NMP”) who contracts via a non-deterministic AI knew of the relevant mistake. Looking ahead, Parliament should legislate that where the NMP issued the disputed offer through a non-deterministic AI, the contract is voidable if a reasonable person should have known of the mistake at the time of the actual trade. Among other benefits, this rule prevents black box AIs from being abused to circumvent the law on unilateral mistakes and more fairly allocates risk between the NMP and his or her counterparty. The black box problem also means that the unconscionability which grounds equity’s jurisdiction in equitable unilateral mistakes will be onerous to prove. Therefore, Singapore’s legislature should further codify a rule for this specific situation: that if the NMP acquires actual knowledge of the mistake post-contract formation, and yet seeks to enforce the contract in a manner amounting to sharp practice or impropriety, rescission remains available, subject to the usual equitable bars. © 2022 Contributor(s) and Singapore Academy of Law.","2-s2.0-85132635814"

Moreover, by generating an optimal disassembly sequence, the time to dismantle the product will be reduced, and in turn, cost also reduces. However, achieving an optimal disassembly sequence is not an easy task as it is an NP-hard combinatorial problem. Many researchers followed different approaches like mathematical, knowledge-based and artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods to generate optimal disassembly sequences. Most of the researchers concentrate on generating the optimal disassembly sequence, but only a few of them discuss the disposal of the parts after EOL. It is very much essential to consider the type of disposal that has to follow the individual components after dismantle to reduce the effect on the environment due to parts of the EOL product. In this research work, a stability graph cut-set method is applied to generate optimal disassembly sequences by considering the minimum number of directional changes as a fitness equation. In the proposed methodology, a stability graph is formulated for the considered assembly to apply cut-set rules for generating optimal assembly sequences. Later, the reverse of the obtained optimal assembly sequences is followed to generate the optimal disassembly sequences. In this strategy, along with the generation of optimal disassembly sequences, the type of disposal (like landfill, incineration and recycling) that has to follow for the individual parts is also discussed using a SOLIDWORKS sustainable tool. The proposed stability graph cut-set method is validated using an eleven-part punching machine assembly to generate the optimal disassembly sequences; also the type of disposal that has to follow for each part after dismantle is discussed. Moreover, the proposed methodology is compared to the well-known algorithms [genetic algorithm (GA) and ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm] in terms of the number of iterations, the number of optimal disassembly sequences generated and fitness value to check the performance of the algorithm. © 2021, Indian Academy of Sciences.","2-s2.0-85100432987"

These disparities are now surfacing in imperial algorithms and exacerbating biased stereotypes in AI systems. We theorise that Kaupapa Māori theory is the foundation for the action of a Kaupapa Māori Modelling IT Artefact that provides solutions to solve whānau, hapū and iwi problems. We reflected on a critical review of selected literature on historical and contemporary Māori leadership and governance to identify elements of mātauranga and tikanga Māori that could enshrine the IT Artefacts. Investigations then took place to seek ways to transfer these elements of mātauranga and tikanga Māori into framed IT Artefacts during the problem initiation stage of the artefact. This paper presents a kaupapa Māori model for the creation of Māori IT artefacts. Whilst no discrete testing was undertaken, the Kaupapa Māori model provides an avenue to pursue an ontological paradigm using cause and effect theory for future research.

It was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It has resulted in an ongoing pandemic that caused infected cases including many deaths. Coronavirus is primarily spread between people during close contact. Motivating to this notion, this research proposes an artificial intelligence system for social distancing classification of persons using thermal images. By exploiting YOLOv2 (you look at once) approach, a novel deep learning detection technique is developed for detecting and tracking people in indoor and outdoor scenarios. An algorithm is also implemented for measuring and classifying the distance between persons and to automatically check if social distancing rules are respected or not. Hence, this work aims at minimizing the spread of the COVID-19 virus by evaluating if and how persons comply with social distancing rules. The proposed approach is applied to images acquired through thermal cameras, to establish a complete AI system for people tracking, social distancing classification, and body temperature monitoring. The training phase is done with two datasets captured from different thermal cameras. Ground Truth Labeler app is used for labeling the persons in the images. The proposed technique has been deployed in a low-cost embedded system (Jetson Nano) which is composed of a fixed camera. The proposed approach is implemented in a distributed surveillance video system to visualize people from several cameras in one centralized monitoring system. The achieved results show that the proposed method is suitable to set up a surveillance system in smart cities for people detection, social distancing classification, and body temperature analysis. © 2021, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85099932482"

Data mining (DM) is considered a process to extract valuable data from a wide range of information stored in various databases. The data is categorized into the form of patterns, associations, changes, anomalies and significant structures. In water recourses management and environmental engineering, predicting and modelling parameters play an integral role in decision making. The most critical freshwater water resource for millions of people worldwide are rivers with a dynamic nature (floods/droughts), in terms of available freshwater quantity and quality. With various basin characteristics, river flow and sediment regime may be influenced by natural processes such as erosion and sediment transport as well as anthropogenic factors such as urban stormwater runoff and semi-treated sanitary/industrial sewage discharge. Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are used to decrease model development costs and improve prediction errors, achieving more efficient models. In this chapter, some well-known techniques and AI-based methods are introduced, and their applications are elaborated. The models are comprised of extreme learning machine (ELM), least square support vector machine (LSSVM), genetic programming (GP), adaptive neural-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS). Each technique, then, is illustrated with a brief literature review. Having being evaluated in terms of the basic concept, the methods are addressed based on a mathematical statement. In the last part, the pseudocode of the ways, an acceptable guideline for coding the methods, is pointed out.

PSM research can address these problems through design science research. Design science is also regarded as the science of the artificial. Design science research is a methodology that aims to systematically generate knowledge for the design, synthesis, testing, and evaluation of human-made artefacts (e.g., tools, interventions, policies) that solve practical problems. PSM artefacts such as the purchasing portfolio matrix invented by Kraljic (1983) represent a valuable opportunity to solve problems in the PSM discipline. However, our artificial-intelligence (AI)-based analysis of the discipline's flagship journal, the Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management (JPSM), indicates that design-oriented publications in PSM are underrepresented, accounting for less than 4% of the total publications. We argue that existing PSM research should be complemented with more design-oriented research, and address the following research question: How can PSM scholars publish more design-oriented research? Our objectives are to (1) provide arguments for advancing PSM as a design science, (2) nurture a better understanding of design science research as a methodology, and (3) propose publication guidelines that enable researchers to present design-oriented research in a management journal. © 2022 The Authors","2-s2.0-85125724659"

However, although data quality has been an object of research for decades, there is a clear lack of research on potential data quality issues (e.g., ambiguous, extraneous values). These kinds of issues are latent in nature and thus often not obvious. Nevertheless, they can be associated with an increased risk of future problems in AI-based systems (e.g., technical debt, data-induced faults). As a counterpart to code smells in software engineering, we refer to such issues as Data Smells. This article conceptualizes data smells and elaborates on their causes, consequences, detection, and use in the context of AI-based systems. In addition, a catalogue of 36 data smells divided into three categories (i.e., Believability Smells, Understandability Smells, Consistency Smells) is presented.

For that purpose, we propose a multi-agent system that combines both machine and human agents. In this system, a checker agent calculates a trust score of each instance (which penalizes overconfidence in predictions) using an agreement-based method and ranks it; then an improver agent filters the anomalous instances based on a human rule-based procedure (which is considered safe), gets the human labels, applies geometric data augmentation, and retrains with the augmented data using transfer learning.

However, the proper application of AI remains a central topic of discussion in many safety-critical fields. This has limited its success in autonomous systems due to the difficulty of ensuring AI algorithms will perform as desired and that users will understand and trust how they operate. In response, there is growing demand for trustability in AI to address both the expectations and concerns regarding its use. The Aerospace Corporation (Aerospace) developed a Framework for Trusted AI (henceforth referred to as the framework) to encourage best practices for the implementation, assessment, and control of AI-based applications. It is generally applicable, being based on terms and definitions that cut across AI domains, and thus is a starting point for practitioners to tailor to their particular application. To help demonstrate how the framework can be tailored into mission assurance guidance for the space domain, Aerospace sought the involvement of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to engage with actual examples of AI-based space autonomy. We report here on the framework's application to two JPL projects. The first, Machine learning-based Analytics for Automated Rover Systems (MAARS), is a suite of algorithms that is intended to run onboard a rover to enhance its safety and productivity. The second, the Ocean Worlds Life Surveyor (OWLS), is comprised of an instrument suite and onboard software that is designed to search for life on an icy moon using microscopy and mass spectrometry while judiciously summarizing and prioritizing science data for downlink. Both MAARS and OWLS are intended to have minimal manual control while relying on complex autonomy software to operate within the unforgiving environment of deep space. Therefore, trusted AI for these systems is required for successful adoption of the autonomy software. To capture the needs for trust, interviews with a variety of JPL personnel responsible for developing autonomy solutions were conducted and are summarized here. Additionally, the application of the framework is presented as a means to lower the barrier for AI deployment. The intent of this document is to encourage researchers, engineers, and program managers to adopt new strategies when considering whether to leverage AI in autonomous systems. © 2022 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85137554372"

Problematic soils or black cotton soils are not good pavement foundation materials except that they are pretreated in order to meet the basic strength characteristics required for roads in Nigeria. Due to this reason, there has been ongoing research to evaluate the best practices in which black cotton soils can be favorably utilized in earthwork construction. On the other hand, there is a huge concern on the solid waste management system in the wood processing environment and the recycling of sawdust into ash and its reuse as an alternative binder has offered a sustainable disposal system. The work tries to use AI-based techniques to predict the crack and shrinkage behaviors of BCS treated with saw dust ash activated with alkali materials. There was appreciable improvement in the shrinkage and crack parameters over the 30-day drying period due to the addition of ASDA. The intelligent model results showed that the three techniques successfully predicted the CW, LS, and VS with a performance accuracy above 90%, while ANN produced the minimal error in performance outperforming the other techniques. Sensitivity study showed that the drying time (T) was the most influential of the studied parameter.

As a result, eleven neurocognitive factors have been identified on which the tremendous creative capacity of the human brain is based. The integration of these factors has made it possible to create a neurocognitive model of human creativity. The analysis of each of creative neurocognitive structures separately suggests certain characteristics that must be present in the structure of a creative computational system to emulate brain creativity.

In contrast to traditional rule-based skill routing, state-of-the-art systems use a model-based approach to enable natural conversations. To provide supervision signal required to train such models, ideas such as human annotation, replication of a rule-based system, relabeling based on user paraphrases, and bandit-based learning were suggested. However, these approaches: (a) do not scale in terms of the number of skills and skill on-boarding, (b) require a very costly expert annotation/rule-design, (c) introduce risks in the user experience with each model update. In this paper, we present a scalable self-learning approach to explore routing alternatives without causing abrupt policy changes that break the user experience, learn from the user interaction, and incrementally improve the routing via frequent model refreshes. To enable such robust frequent model updates, we suggest a simple and effective approach that ensures controlled policy updates for individual domains, followed by an off-policy evaluation for making deployment decisions without any need for lengthy A/B experimentation. We conduct various offline and online A/B experiments on a commercial large-scale conversational system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world production settings. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","2-s2.0-85137728094"

Some enhanced technologies for 5G like equipment deep sleep and symbol aggregation have also been introduced in this article.

To meet the requirements and development of intelligent and self-adaptive energy-saving solution, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data analysis are introduced to form a more precise energy-saving strategy based on site-specific traffic and site-related conditions, thus improving the efficiency and reducing the manpower. Finally, two commercial application practices of AI-based energy-saving solution are elaborated. One is the practice of AI-based service awareness energy saving for 4G/5G collaborative networks, the energy benefits can be improved up to 20%; The other practice is the adoption of a new architecture Active Antenna Unit (AAU) with beam pattern optimization, its energy benefits can be promoted by 30%.

DDoS is difficultly defended due to the two research problems (1) indistinguishability of the changing DDoS characteristics and (2) the time series attack pattern, leading that the raising attention of developing varying DDoS defending methodologies. The conventional methods to defend DDoS apply a rules-based methodology that relies on the experience of algorithm designers and cannot reflect the changing attack characteristics of DDoS in a timely manner. Numerous artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, therefore, are introduced to defend DDoS through end-to-end functionality (Input: network status; Output: defending action) without any manual intervention. However, the AI-based DDoS Defending model often outsources training to a machine-learning-as-a-service (MLaaS) provider because of the scarce training dataset and high hardware requirement. This may cause the model been trained maliciously, which is called the Artificial Intelligence Trojan attack (AI Trojan). AI Trojan means an AI model encounters a malicious training process and then have a good performance on normal data but behaves maliciously with certain data. This study proposes GAN based AI Robustness test algorithm, Deep Learning Attack Generator (DLAG), to verify that the artificial intelligence model has been fully trained to ensure the robustness of the model. DLAG can be divided into five steps: (1) DLAG randomly generates a sample, (2) generates noise that participates in the generation of a confrontation network (DLAG), (3) input the synthetic sample to the testing AI, (4) the test results will be recorded in the test report and fed back to GAN, and (5) a new synthetic sample will be generated again for the next test cycle. The simulation shows that our proposed DLAG can detect that the AI based DDoS/LFA detector is trained by imbalance data. The simulation results also demonstrate the potential and suggested development trait of AI Trojan detection methodology. © 2022 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85127606976"

Recently, the idea of design patterns not only stipulated an initial collection and classification of machine learning patterns, but has also been used to structure and document machine learning based systems from a traditional software engineering perspective. We promote the idea of using design patterns as a general means to visualize the design of hybrid AI systems and present how the strategy design pattern in particular can be used for a passenger counting system by switching the implementation strategies from a standard YOLOv5 based object recognition with Deep Sort tracking to a customized head-based YOLOv5 detection in combination with a customized Deep Sort tracking strategy. In our example, the newly presented human head detector and tracker could significantly improve the overall accuracy of passenger counting in dense and crowded situations. Furthermore, we show, how rule-based symbolic decisions can be allocated to an abstractstrategy class, while the sub-symbolic machine learning task is delegated to the most appropriate person- or head-based ConcreteStrategy class during run-time. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors","2-s2.0-85128713363"

Network administrators and vendors are now moving beyond conventional Intrusion-Detection Systems (IDS), that only identify problems after they have occurred, to a novel, constructive approach termed Artificial Intelligence (AI) based intrusion detection system. Conventional network Intrusion Detection Systems and firewalls are usually preconfigured to spot malicious network attacks. Now-a-days attackers have become profounder and can try evading common detection rules. There are a few targeted areas where Artificial Intelligence will distribute the extreme evolution for Cybersecurity. To design a proactive defence mechanism, the system has to understand the intelligence of threats that are currently targeting the organization. The implementation of Machine Learning (ML) and threat intelligent-based solutions into blend can revolutionize the landscape in cyber security industry against any kinds of network attacks. Machine Learning is an application of AI that uses a system which is capable of learning from experience. Even in the era of extremely large amount of data and cybersecurity skill shortage, ML can aid in solving the most common tasks including regression, prediction, and classification. In this chapter, the origin and evolution of IDS has been described, followed by the classification of IDS. This chapter will provide a truly interactive learning experience to help and prepare the researchers for the challenges in traditional IDS and the contributions of ML in IDS. This comprehensive review briefs the prominent current works, and an outline of the datasets frequently used for evaluation purpose. Moreover, this chapter will also describe the Collaborative Intrusion Detection that enhances the Big Data Security.

Reviewing current traffic rules with particular reference to two driving situations (speeding and mounting the pavement), we illustrate why current traffic rules are not suitable for CAVs and why making new traffic rules specifically for CAVs would be inappropriate. In defining an alternative approach to achieving safe CAV driving behaviours, we describe the use of ethical goal functions as part of hybrid AI systems, suggesting that functions should be defined by governmental bodies with input from citizens and stakeholders. Ethical goal functions for CAVs would enable developers to optimise driving behaviours for safety under conditions of uncertainty whilst allowing for differentiation of products according to brand values. Such functions can differ between regions according to preferences for safety behaviours within that region and can be updated over time, responding to continual socio-technological feedback loops. We conclude that defining ethical goal functions is an urgent and necessary step from governmental bodies to enable the safe and transparent operation of CAVs and accelerate the reduction in road casualties they promise to achieve. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","2-s2.0-85116824375"

These problems can lead to several neurological and physical disorders and adversely affect the overall quality of life. Artificial intelligence (AI)based methods for automated sleep stage classification is a fundamental approach to evaluating and treating this public health challenge.The main contribution of this research work is to develop an Automated Sleep Staging System based on Two-Layer Heterogeneous Ensemble Learning Stacking Model (ASSS-TL-HELSM) for sleep staging under the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) sleep scoring rules. The main aim of this model is to enhance sleep staging accuracy, reduce overfitting and handle overdrift. For signal preprocessing, we use two different feature selection techniques, Fisher Score (FS), and ReliefF (ReF). For feature extraction, we obtain a total of 28 features.The proposed model analyzes the sleep behavior of the subject using the seasonal and trend components. Sleep recordings from two different subgroups of Institute of Systems and Robotics University of Coimbra (ISRUC-Sleep) were obtained for our experiments.Compared with recent studies using single-channel electro encephalogram (EEG) signals, our proposed ASSS-TL-HELSM model shows the best sleep staging classification accuracy performance on a five sleep stages classification (SC-5) task. The overall classification accuracy is 97.93%, and 97% for features selected through FS and ReF respectively, with the subgroup-I(SG-I) data; similarly, for the subgroup-III(SG-III) data, the features selected through FS, and ReF show a classification accuracy of 98.16% and 98.78% respectively. The comparisons between the proposed model and the existing model show that the proposed model gives better sleep staging accuracy for the five-sleep state's classification. © 2022 University of Bahrain.

Being able to reproduce DL models is crucial for AI-based systems, as it is closely tied to various tasks like training, testing, debugging, and auditing. However, DL models are challenging to be reproduced due to issues like randomness in the software (e.g., DL algorithms) and non-determinism in the hardware (e.g., GPU). There are various practices to mitigate some of the aforementioned issues. However, many of them are either too intrusive or can only work for a specific usage context. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to training reproducible DL models. Our approach includes three main parts: (1) a set of general criteria to thoroughly evaluate the reproducibility of DL models for two different domains, (2) a unified framework which leverages a record-and-replay technique to mitigate software-related randomness and a profile-and-patch technique to control hardware-related non-determinism, and (3) a reproducibility guideline which explains the rationales and the mitigation strategies on conducting a reproducible training process for DL models.

The development of digital phenotyping promises to improve BD management. We present a systematic review of the evidence about the use of portable digital devices for the identification of BD, BD types and BD mood states and for symptom assessment. Methods: We searched Web of KnowledgeSM, Scopus ®, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library databases (until 5/1/2021) for articles evaluating the use of portable/wearable digital devices, such as smartphone apps, wearable sensors, audio and/or visual recordings, and multimodal tools. The protocol is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020200086). Results: We included 62 studies (2325 BD; 724 healthy controls, HC): 27 using smartphone apps, either for recording self-assessments (n = 10) or for passively gathering metadata (n = 7) or both (n = 10); 15 using wearable sensors for physiological parameters; 17 analysing audio and/or video recordings; 3 using multiple technologies. Two thirds of the included studies applied artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches. They achieved fair to excellent classification performances. Limitations: The included studies had small sample sizes and marked heterogeneity. Evidence of overfitting emerged, limiting generalizability. The absence of clear guidelines about reporting classification performances, with no shared standard metrics, makes results hardly interpretable and comparable. Conclusions: New technologies offer a noteworthy opportunity to BD digital phenotyping with objectivity and high granularity. AI-based models could deliver important support in clinical decision-making. Further research and cooperation between different stakeholders are needed for addressing methodological, ethical and socio-economic considerations. © 2021","2-s2.0-85114136094"

It argues that in order to meaningfully address risks to fundamental rights the proposed classification of these systems should be reconsidered. Although the draft AI Act acknowledges that some AI practices should be prohibited, the multiple exceptions and loopholes should be closed, and in addition new prohibitions, in particular to emotional recognition and biometric categorisation systems, should be added to counter AI surveillance practices violating fundamental rights. The AI Act should also introduce stronger legal requirements, such as third-party conformity assessment, fundamental rights impact assessment, transparency obligations as well as enhance existing EU data protection law and the rights and remedies available to individuals, thus not missing the unique opportunity to adopt the first legal framework that truly promotes trustworthy AI.  © 2022-The authors.

To handle this problem, we proposed a deep multi-modal learning approach called multi-modal anomaly root cause analysis, which enables network operation and maintenance systems to automatically and effectively associate the related network anomalies that appear from different modalities or aspects, and then locate the root causes. As a self/semi-supervised approach, our proposal is capable of realizing self-learning, self-adapting, and does not rely on a large number of manual annotations. According to the experimental results in a real large-scale network, without any annotations, our approach achieves up to 14% accuracy improvement in terms of multi-modal network anomaly association and root cause locating compared to the classical association rule mining algorithm Apriori, while its performance turns even much better when a few of labeled training samples are provided. The experiment also well proves the versatility and self-adaptability of our approach, which means our learning-based approach is able to not only achieve fast convergence but also automatically adapt itself to network changes. © 2022 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85137259916"

AI is also assisting in the identification of criminals. As a public safety resource, AI is being researched in a number of ways. Face recognition is becoming increasingly popular as an AI application in both the public and private sectors. For law enforcement authorities, AI applications boost efficiency, promote data-driven processes, and extend capabilities. AI technology can help law enforcement agencies make judgments and complete tasks in general. They can strengthen data-driven procedures, increase efficiency, or extend capabilities for specific activities or choices. However, recognized human rights as adjudicated by European Convention of Human Rights are calling for caution in the development and usage of AI within the European Union. Fair Trials and 114 civil society organizations have launched a collective statement to call for an Artificial Intelligence Act which foregrounds fundamental rights in November 2021. This Act is under preparation in the EU. Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI from 2019, by High Level Expert Group on Artificial intelligence set up by the European Commission, (hereinafter: Ethical Guidelines) are underlining how it is necessary to develop, deploy and use trustworthy AI systems in a way that adheres to the ethical principles of: respect for human autonomy, prevention of harm, fairness and explicability.

Ambiguity and incompleteness due to missing values in output and input attributes, respectively, is ubiquitous in these domains. It could have an adverse impact on a certain unrepresented set of people in the training data without a developer's intention to discriminate. The inherently non-numerical nature of categorical attributes than numerical attributes and the presence of incomplete and ambiguous categorical attributes in a dataset increases the uncertainty in decision-making. This paper addresses the challenges in handling categorical attributes as it is not addressed comprehensively in previous research. Three sources of uncertainties in categorical attributes are recognised in this research. The informational uncertainty, unforeseeable uncertainty in the decision task environment, and the uncertainty due to lack of pre-modelling explainability in categorical attributes are addressed in the proposed methodology on maximum likelihood evidential reasoning (MAKER). It can transform and impute incomplete and ambiguous categorical attributes into interpretable numerical features. It utilises a notion of weight and reliability to include subjective expert preference over a piece of evidence and the quality of evidence in a categorical attribute, respectively. The MAKER framework strives to integrate the recognised uncertainties in the transformed input data that allow a model to perceive data limitations during the training regime and acknowledge doubtful predictions by supporting trustworthy pre-modelling and post modelling explainability. The ability to handle uncertainty and its impact on explainability is demonstrated on a real-world healthcare and finance data for different missing data scenarios in three types of AI algorithms: deep-learning, tree-based, and rule-based model. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85111606362"

The most recently published clinical guidelines for heart failure recognise that over reliance on only one measure of cardiac function (LV ejection fraction) as a diagnostic and treatment stratification biomarker is suboptimal. Recent advances in AI-based echocardiography analysis have shown excellent results on automated estimation of LV volumes and LV ejection fraction. However, from time-varying 2-D echocardiography acquisition, a richer description of cardiac function can be obtained by estimating functional biomarkers from the complete cardiac cycle. In this work we propose for the first time an AI approach for deriving advanced biomarkers of systolic and diastolic LV function from 2-D echocardiography based on segmentations of the full cardiac cycle. These biomarkers will allow clinicians to obtain a much richer picture of the heart in health and disease. The AI model is based on the ’nn-Unet’ framework and was trained and tested using four different databases. Results show excellent agreement between manual and automated analysis and showcase the potential of the advanced systolic and diastolic biomarkers for patient stratification. Finally, for a subset of 50 cases, we perform a correlation analysis between clinical biomarkers derived from echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance and we show a very strong relationship between the two modalities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85138818721"

Mamdani fuzzy systems can provide explanations based on their linguistic rules, and thus a potential pathway to XAI. A factual rule based explanation generally refers to the given set of rules executed, or fired, for a given input. However, research has shown that human explanations are often counterfactual (CF), i.e. rather than explaining why a given output was reached, they show why other potential outputs were not. Although several machine learning-based CF explanation generation methods have been proposed in recent years, quasi none of them focus on fuzzy systems. Also, where they do, they focus on correlation, which limits the interpretive value of any CF explanations obtained as humans expect a causal relationship in rules, i.e. we are cause-effect thinkers. In this paper, we propose a new rule generation framework for Mamdani fuzzy classification systems, which we refer to as CF-MABLAR, building on the MARkov BLAnket Rules (MABLAR) framework.

However, what is currently missing is a combined appreciation of studies comparing human readers and AI. Methods: We followed PRISMA-DTA guidelines for our systematic review, searching EMBASE, PUBMED and Scopus databases. To gain insights into the potential value of AI methods, we focused on studies comparing the performance of human readers versus AI models or versus AI-supported human readings. Results: Our search identified 1270 studies, of which 12 fulfilled specific selection criteria. Concerning diagnostic performance, in testing datasets reported sensitivity was 42–100% (human readers, n = 9 studies), 60–95% (AI systems, n = 10) and 81–98% (AI-supported readers, n = 3), whilst reported specificity was 26–100% (human readers, n = 8), 61–96% (AI systems, n = 10) and 78–99% (AI-supported readings, n = 2). One study highlighted the potential of AI-supported readings for the assessment of lung lesion burden changes, whilst two studies indicated potential time savings for detection with AI. Conclusions: Our review indicates that AI systems or AI-supported human readings show less performance variability (interquartile range) in general, and may support the differentiation of COVID-19 pneumonia from other forms of pneumonia when used in high-prevalence and symptomatic populations. However, inconsistencies related to study design, reporting of data, areas of risk of bias, as well as limitations of statistical analyses complicate clear conclusions. We therefore support efforts for developing critical elements of study design when assessing the value of AI for diagnostic imaging. © 2021 The Author(s)","2-s2.0-85119896652"

The factors of user experience, usability and joy of use significantly determine the quality of an HMI, but are still insufficiently researched for medical AI applications. This work addresses this gap and provides generally applicable design guidelines to AI-based mobile medical applications.

Furthermore, the authors discuss the tactics in which information technology is used to implement business strategies to transform businesses and to incentivise the implementation of these technologies in current or future emergency situations. Design/methodology/approach: The review provides the rapidly growing literature on the use of smart technology during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: The 127 empirical articles the authors have identified suggest that 39 forms of smart technologies have been used, ranging from artificial intelligence to computer vision technology. Eight different industries have been identified that are using these technologies, primarily food services and manufacturing. Further, the authors list 40 generalised types of activities that are involved including providing health services, data analysis and communication. To prevent the spread of illness, robots with artificial intelligence are being used to examine patients and give drugs to them. The online execution of teaching practices and simulators have replaced the classroom mode of teaching due to the epidemic. The AI-based Blue-dot algorithm aids in the detection of early warning indications. The AI model detects a patient in respiratory distress based on face detection, face recognition, facial action unit detection, expression recognition, posture, extremity movement analysis, visitation frequency detection, sound pressure detection and light level detection. The above and various other applications are listed throughout the paper. Research limitations/implications: Research is largely delimited to the area of COVID-19-related studies. Also, bias of selective assessment may be present. In Indian context, advanced technology is yet to be harnessed to its full extent. Also, educational system is yet to be upgraded to add these technologies potential benefits on wider basis. Practical implications: First, leveraging of insights across various industry sectors to battle the global threat, and smart technology is one of the key takeaways in this field. Second, an integrated framework is recommended for policy making in this area. Lastly, the authors recommend that an internet-based repository should be developed, keeping all the ideas, databases, best practices, dashboard and real-time statistical data.

This explains the concept of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), which increases the faith held in a system, thus leading to more widespread use of AI in healthcare. In this chapter, we offer diverse ways of viewing the XAI concepts, understandability and interpretability of explainable AI systems, mainly focussing on the healthcare domain. The intention is to educate healthcare providers on the understandability and interpretability of explainable AI systems.

One of such challenges is achieving a smooth transition from the explorative phase of Machine Learning projects - in which data scientists build prototypical models in the lab - to their production phase - in which software engineers translate prototypes into production-ready AI components. To narrow down the gap between these two phases, tools and practices adopted by data scientists might be improved by incorporating consolidated software engineering solutions. In particular, computational notebooks have a prominent role in determining the quality of data science prototypes.

In connection with variable corporate goals such as fluctuating workload, agile responsiveness to customer inquiries, ecological and economic sustainability which require an intelligent and forward-looking management of the company. Hence, a prototype solution has been created to respond to a very dynamic market. Based on Microsoft PowerPoint (ISpring) and with some add-ons pre-selected operators may interact, including with video content. The current architecture of the IT system has already been done. Adjustments will still be made to become more agile and future-driven to follow all of the company business rules. An artificial intelligence (AI)-based methodical analysis and synthesis approach is followed, for human and other resource input calculation, to follow business KPIs (key performance indicators) and other business goals with an algorithm. This evolution or control system is seen as a natural response to a very complex environment where human effort and error must be minimized (through simplification and a mathematical algorithm and a fast loop e.g., every ten minutes KPIs may be re-calculated according to existing capacity due to availability of equipment and human resources). This holistic approach shortens reaction times to market situations and at the same time minimizes non-value-adding processes. The business roles are determined depending on the culture/size of the company and strategic parameters. The continuously available flexibility in product design and the instability of all resources is of significant importance. After initial research it was found that commercial systems do not have this ability to dynamically and agilely automatically adapt to the given optimum. Instead of isolated partial optimizations, the expected results are compared with the real results in a continuous dynamic simulation and readjusted promptly [1]. This algorithm represents the actual added value, which has a high economic but also humanity advantage, especially in the manufacturing industry. In the future most manufacturing enterprises will have to follow this AI and agile path to competitive advantage vis-à-vis Asian competitors.

As part of green railway initiatives, a site trial was conducted to apply a fully automated AI system to control a chiller plant in order to optimise energy performance in real time while maintaining a level of passenger comfort that suits each station’s environment. Through the predictive power of the AI system, the plant power’s consumption and cooling demands can be forecasted based on actual chiller, station, and weather conditions, all of which vary over time. The optimal operational settings can then be determined using an optimisation model for real-time chiller plant control, including staging, sequencing, chilled water supply temperature set-point, etc. This paper presents the formulation of an AI system using data-driven machine learning models and numerical optimisation, and the comparison of the actual energy performance of the proposed system against rule-based control optimisation in a conventional building management system (BMS) through the site trial.

Based on the assumption  that AI systems operate likeghostwriters in terms of their creativity, this paperasks whether AI’s creationshould be subject to copyright regulations soon, and if so, to what extent. © 2022, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources.

These have been applied to many medical imaging tasks, including disease diagnosis and patient prognosis, as well as augmented other clinical measurements to better inform treatment decisions. Because these systems are used in life-or-death decisions, clinical implementation relies on user trust in the AI output. This has caused many developers to utilize explainability techniques in an attempt to help a user understand when an AI algorithm is likely to succeed as well as which cases may be problematic for automatic assessment, thus increasing the potential for rapid clinical translation. AI application to COVID-19 has been marred with controversy recently. This review discusses several aspects of explainable and interpretable AI as it pertains to the evaluation of COVID-19 disease and it can restore trust in AI application to this disease. This includes the identification of common tasks that are relevant to explainable medical imaging AI, an overview of several modern approaches for producing explainable output as appropriate for a given imaging scenario, a discussion of how to evaluate explainable AI, and recommendations for best practices in explainable/interpretable AI implementation. This review will allow developers of AI systems for COVID-19 to quickly understand the basics of several explainable AI techniques and assist in the selection of an approach that is both appropriate and effective for a given scenario. © 2021 American Association of Physicists in Medicine","2-s2.0-85120684954"

However, the increase in the number of students has brought great pressure to CET. How to improve the teaching efficiency of large classes is an urgent problem to be solved. The development of sci and tech, especially computer, has brought us new hope. Computer-assisted instruction has been introduced into CET. However, there are some unreasonable points in the design of computer-aided marking system in China, which is not suitable for CET. It is very important to research and design a computer-aided marking system that can expand CET methods and maximize the integration of English instructional resources.

Since most Internet of Things (IoT) devices are plug and play and do not have much memory or storage to pre-process data, it is a challenge for forensic investigators to identify and obtain relevant evidence to reconstruct attacks. As a solution, we propose using artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired techniques to automate the forensic analysis process by emulating attacks in the process of identifying and collecting forensic evidence. We used a differentiable inductive logic programming (∂ILP) system to obtain attack emulation information from different sources, such as device- and subsystem-level vulnerabilities gathered by assessing device components in an enterprise network, and to predict potential attacks from previous attacks on similar configurations. Our experimental results showed that the proposed methodology could successfully generate rules that can assist forensic examiners in identifying evidence to emulate attacks without execution.  © 2022 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85134268800"

Early prediction of cardiac arrest is important, as it allows for the necessary measures to be taken to prevent or intervene during the onset. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and big data have been increasingly used to enhance the ability to predict and prepare for the patients at risk. Objective: This study aims to explore the use of AI technology in predicting cardiac arrest as reported in the literature. Methods: A scoping review was conducted in line with the guidelines of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) extension for scoping reviews. Scopus, ScienceDirect, Embase, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and Google Scholar were searched to identify relevant studies. Backward reference list checks of the included studies were also conducted. Study selection and data extraction were independently conducted by 2 reviewers. Data extracted from the included studies were synthesized narratively. Results: Out of 697 citations retrieved, 41 studies were included in the review, and 6 were added after backward citation checking. The included studies reported the use of AI in the prediction of cardiac arrest. Of the 47 studies, we were able to classify the approaches taken by the studies into 3 different categories: 26 (55%) studies predicted cardiac arrest by analyzing specific parameters or variables of the patients, whereas 16 (34%) studies developed an AI-based warning system. The remaining 11% (5/47) of studies focused on distinguishing patients at high risk of cardiac arrest from patients who were not at risk. Two studies focused on the pediatric population, and the rest focused on adults (45/47, 96%). Most of the studies used data sets with a size of <10,000 samples (32/47, 68%). Machine learning models were the most prominent branch of AI used in the prediction of cardiac arrest in the studies (38/47, 81%), and the most used algorithm was the neural network (23/47, 49%). K-fold cross-validation was the most used algorithm evaluation tool reported in the studies (24/47, 51%). Conclusions: AI is extensively used to predict cardiac arrest in different patient settings. Technology is expected to play an integral role in improving cardiac medicine. There is a need for more reviews to learn the obstacles to the implementation of AI technologies in clinical settings. Moreover, research focusing on how to best provide clinicians with support to understand, adapt, and implement this technology in their practice is also necessary. © Asma Alamgir, Osama Mousa, Zubair Shah.","2-s2.0-85122037508"

However, there are still relatively few case studies that describe the current state of defining these quality requirements in practice. [Question] The goal of our study was to explore what ethical guidelines organizations have defined for the development of transparent and explainable AI systems. We analyzed the ethical guidelines in 16 organizations representing different industries and public sector. [Results] In the ethical guidelines, the importance of transparency was highlighted by almost all of the organizations, and explainability was considered as an integral part of transparency. Building trust in AI systems was one of the key reasons for developing transparency and explainability, and customers and users were raised as the main target groups of the explanations. The organizations also mentioned developers, partners, and stakeholders as important groups needing explanations. The ethical guidelines contained the following aspects of the AI system that should be explained: the purpose, role of AI, inputs, behavior, data utilized, outputs, and limitations. The guidelines also pointed out that transparency and explainability relate to several other quality requirements, such as trustworthiness, understandability, traceability, privacy, auditability, and fairness. [Contribution] For researchers, this paper provides insights into what organizations consider important in the transparency and, in particular, explainability of AI systems. For practitioners, this study suggests a structured way to define explainability requirements of AI systems. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85127079762"

Especially, retail customers of SAP deal with millions of sales transactions for their day-to-day business. Transactions are created during retail sales at the point of sale (POS) terminals and those transactions are then sent to some central servers for validations and other business operations. A considerable proportion of the retail transactions may have inconsistencies or anomalies due to many technical and human errors. SAP provides an automated process for error detection but still requires a manual process by dedicated employees using workbench software for correction. However, manual corrections of these errors are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and might be prone to further errors due to incorrect modifications. Thus, automated detection and correction of transaction errors are very important regarding their potential business values and the improvement in the business workflow. In this paper, we report on our experience from a project where we develop an AI-based system to automatically detect transaction errors and propose corrections. We identify and discuss the challenges that we faced during this collaborative research and development project, from two distinct perspectives: Software Engineering and Machine Learning. We report on our experience and insights from the project with guidelines for the identified challenges. We collect developers' feedback for qualitative analysis of our findings.

Objective: The purpose of this scoping review is to summarize the extent to which AI systems in primary care examine the inherent bias toward or against vulnerable populations and appraise how these systems have mitigated the impact of such biases during their development. Methods: We will conduct a search update from an existing scoping review to identify studies on AI and primary care in the following databases: Medline-OVID, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, MathSciNet, AAAI, and arXiv. Two screeners will independently review all abstracts, titles, and full-text articles. The team will extract data using a structured data extraction form and synthesize the results in accordance with PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. Results: This review will provide an assessment of the current state of health care equity within AI for primary care. Specifically, we will identify the degree to which vulnerable patients have been included, assess how bias is interpreted and documented, and understand the extent to which harmful biases are addressed. As of October 2020, the scoping review is in the title- and abstract-screening stage. The results are expected to be submitted for publication in fall 2021. Conclusions: AI applications in primary care are becoming an increasingly common tool in health care delivery and in preventative care efforts for underserved populations.

Around a hundred governmental bodies and commissions as well as leaders in the tech sector have proposed principles to create responsible AI systems. However, most of these proposals are short on specifics which has led to charges of ethics washing. In this tutorial we offer a guide to help navigate through complex governmental regulations and explain the various constituent practical elements of a responsible AI system in healthcare in the light of proposed regulations. Additionally, we breakdown and emphasize that the recommendations from regulatory bodies like FDA or the EU are necessary but not sufficient elements of creating a responsible AI system. We elucidate how regulations and guidelines often focus on epistemic concerns to the detriment of practical concerns e.g., requirement for fairness without explicating what fairness constitutes for a use case. FDA's Software as a medical device document and EU's GDPR among other AI governance documents talk about the need for implementing sufficiently good machine learning practices. In this tutorial we elucidate what that would mean from a practical perspective for real world use cases in healthcare throughout the machine learning cycle i.e., Data Management, Data Specification, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation, Model Specification, Model Explainability, Model Fairness, Reproducibility, checks for data leakage and model leakage. We note that conceptualizing responsible AI as a process rather than an end goal accords well with how AI systems are used in practice. We also discuss how a domain centric stakeholder perspective translates into balancing requirements for multiple competing optimization criteria.  © 2021 Owner/Author.","2-s2.0-85114920107"

Although it is mainly focused on polyp detection and characterization, it also considers other potential applications (i.e., inflammatory bowel disease) and future perspectives. Some of the most recent algorithms show promising results that are similar to human expert performance. The integration of AI in routine clinical practice will be challenging, with significant issues to overcome (i.e., regulatory, reimbursement). Medico-legal issues will also need to be addressed. With the exception of an AI system that is already available in selected countries (GI Genius; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA), the majority of the technology is still in its infancy and has not yet been proven to reach a sufficient diagnostic performance to be adopted in the clinical practice.

How to guide students to learn and communicate actively, and explore and improve the new student-centered teaching mode, has become the key problem to be solved. In the mixed cloud environment, the data stream is disturbed, and the error of mining association data is large. Aiming at the problem of poor anti-interference of scattered point cloud adaptive compression mining algorithm, this paper analyzes the data mining technology in cloud environment. Firstly, the time series analysis model of big data information flow in hybrid cloud environment is constructed to analyze the data structure, and then the high-dimensional phase space of data information flow in hybrid cloud environment is reconstructed. In the reconstructed phase space, the association rules are extracted, and the extracted features are used as pheromones to guide data location mining, so as to improve the data mining algorithm.  © 2021 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85107588586"

As technology is evolving day by day and to sustain itself in the food industry the restaurant needs to come up with new and innovative services which they can provide to the customers. Pandemic has made a major impact on the business of the restaurant industry in 2020. This paper will help to understand how technology can help in food ordering, while taking care of the COVID-19 pandemic guidelines. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of COVID-19 in the food industry and suggest methods that would help restaurants to adapt to challenges that originate from COVID-19. One of the ways would be to automate the food ordering process. Our Project 'Contactless food ordering system' is a mobile application operated by a voice assistant. That the client (The Restaurant Customer) can use to scan through the restaurant menu and view various food categories and items like 'Starter' 'Drinks' etc. and place their order through the Application. They can modify and confirm their order, as well as make their payment. The aim of the study is to reduce the point of contact during COVID-19 and automate the ordering and billing process, simplifying the work. Thus, providing a totally computerized, automated, and scalable food ordering system that will assist the business by reducing their workload, provide better management and smooth operation. The restaurant can also use various other means to increase their presence as a business.  © 2021 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85107529764"

Due to the rarity of these tumors, there are significant differences in quality in the diagnosis and treatment of these tumors. One paramount aspect is the diagnosis of hematogenous metastases in the lungs. Guidelines recommend routine lung imaging by means of X‐rays. With the ever advancing AI‐based diagnostic support, there has so far been no implementation for sarcomas. The aim of the study was to utilize AI to obtain ana-lyzes regarding metastasis on lung X‐rays in the most possible sensitive and specific manner in sarcoma patients. Methods: a Python script was created and trained using a set of lung X‐rays with sarcoma metastases from a high‐volume German‐speaking sarcoma center. 26 patients with lung metastasis were included. For all patients chest X‐ray with corresponding lung CT scans, and his-tological biopsies were available. The number of trainable images were expanded to 600. In order to evaluate the biological sensitivity and specificity, the script was tested on lung X‐rays with a lung CT as control. Results: in this study we present a new type of convolutional neural network‐based system with a precision of 71.2%, specificity of 90.5%, sensitivity of 94%, recall of 94% and accuracy of 91.2%. A good detection of even small findings was determined. Discussion: the created script establishes the option to check lung X‐rays for metastases at a safe level, especially given this rare tumor entity. © 2021 by the authors.

Benefits include applications to improve health systems, such as rapid and accurate interpretation of medical images. This may improve the performance of diagnostic, prognostic and management decisions. While a large amount of work has been undertaken discussing the role of AI little is understood regarding the performance of such applications in the clinical setting. This systematic review aims to critically appraise the diagnostic performance of AI algorithms to identify disease from cross-sectional radiological images of the abdominopelvic cavity, to identify current limitations and inform future research. Methods and analysis A systematic search will be conducted on Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify relevant studies. Primary studies where AI-based technologies have been used as a diagnostic aid in cross-sectional radiological images of the abdominopelvic cavity will be included. Diagnostic accuracy of AI models, including reported sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratios and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve will be examined and compared with standard practice. Risk of bias of included studies will be assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Findings will be reported according to the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis guidelines. Ethics and dissemination No ethical approval is required as primary data will not be collected. The results will inform further research studies in this field. Findings will be disseminated at relevant conferences, on social media and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

To intelligently solve today’s various cybersecurity issues, popular AI techniques involving machine learning and deep learning methods, the concept of natural language processing, knowledge representation and reasoning, as well as the concept of knowledge or rule-based expert systems modeling can be used. Based on these AI methods, in this paper, we present a comprehensive view on “AI-driven Cybersecurity” that can play an important role for intelligent cybersecurity services and management. The security intelligence modeling based on such AI methods can make the cybersecurity computing process automated and intelligent than the conventional security systems. We also highlight several research directions within the scope of our study, which can help researchers do future research in the area.

Though some developed countries prepared guidelines for evaluation of LBP with tests to detect psychological overlay, implementation of the recommendations becomes quite difficult in regular clinical practice, and different specialties of medicine offer different modes of management. Aiming at offering an expert-level diagnosis for the patients having LBP, this paper uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to derive a clinically justified and highly sensitive LBP resolution technique. Materials and methods: The paper considers exhaustive knowledge for different LBP disorders (classified based on different pain generators), which have been represented using lattice structures to ensure completeness, non-redundancy, and optimality in the design of knowledge base. Further the representational enhancement of the knowledge has been done through construction of a hierarchical network, called RuleNet, using the concept of partially-ordered set (poset) with respect to the subset equality (⊆) relation. With implicit incorporation of probability within the knowledge, the RuleNet is used to derive reliable resolution logic along with effective resolution of uncertainties during clinical decision making. Results: The proposed methodology has been validated with clinical records of seventy seven LBP patients accessed from the database of ESI Hospital Sealdah, India over a period of one year from 2018 to 2019. Achieving 83% sensitivity of the proposed technique, the pain experts at the hospital find the design clinically satisfactory. The inferred outcomes have also been found to be homogeneous with the actual or original diagnosis. Discussions: The proposed approach achieves the clinical and computational efficiency by limiting the shortcomings of the existing methodologies for AI-based LBP diagnosis. While computational efficiency (with respect to both time and space complexity) is ensured by inferring clinical decisions through optimal processing of the knowledge items using poset, the clinical acceptability has been ascertained reaching to the most-likely diagnostic outcomes through probabilistic resolution of clinical uncertainties. Conclusion: The derived resolution technique, when embedded in LBP medical expert systems, would provide a fast, reliable, and affordable healthcare solution for this ailment to a wider range of general population suffering from LBP. The proposed scheme would significantly reduce the controversies and confusion in LBP treatment, and cut down the cost of unnecessary or inappropriate treatment and referral. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85114954635"

Artificial intelligence (AI)-based wound assessment tools have the potential to improve the accuracy and consistency of wound area and PGT measurement, while improving efficiency of wound care workflows. Objective: To develop a quantitative and qualitative method to evaluate AI-based wound assessment tools compared with expert human assessments. Design, Setting, and Participants: This diagnostic study was performed across 2 independent wound centers using deidentified wound photographs collected for routine care (site 1, 110 photographs taken between May 1 and 31, 2018; site 2, 89 photographs taken between January 1 and December 31, 2019). Digital wound photographs of patients were selected chronologically from the electronic medical records from the general population of patients visiting the wound centers. For inclusion in the study, the complete wound edge and a ruler were required to be visible; circumferential ulcers were specifically excluded. Four wound specialists (2 per site) and an AI-based wound assessment service independently traced wound area and granulation tissue. Main Outcomes and Measures: The quantitative performance of AI tracings was evaluated by statistically comparing error measure distributions between test AI traces and reference human traces (AI vs human) with error distributions between independent traces by 2 humans (human vs human). Quantitative outcomes included statistically significant differences in error measures of false-negative area (FNA), false-positive area (FPA), and absolute relative error (ARE) between AI vs human and human vs human comparisons of wound area and granulation tissue tracings. Six masked attending physician reviewers (3 per site) viewed randomized area tracings for AI and human annotators and qualitatively assessed them. Qualitative outcomes included statistically significant difference in the absolute difference between AI-based PGT measurements and mean reviewer visual PGT estimates compared with PGT estimate variability measures (ie, range, standard deviation) across reviewers. Results: A total of 199 photographs were selected for the study across both sites; mean (SD) patient age was 64 (18) years (range, 17-95 years) and 127 (63.8%) were women. The comparisons of AI vs human with human vs human for FPA and ARE were not statistically significant. AI vs human FNA was slightly elevated compared with human vs human FNA (median [IQR], 7.7% [2.7%-21.2%] vs 5.7% [1.6%-14.9%]; P <.001), indicating that AI traces tended to slightly underestimate the human reference wound boundaries compared with human test traces. Two of 6 reviewers had a statistically higher frequency in agreement that human tracings met the standard area definition, but overall agreement was moderate (352 yes responses of 583 total responses [60.4%] for AI and 793 yes responses of 1166 total responses [68.0%] for human tracings). AI PGT measurements fell in the typical range of variation in interreviewer visual PGT estimates; however, visual PGT estimates varied considerably (mean range, 34.8%; mean SD, 19.6%). Conclusions and Relevance: This study provides a framework for evaluating AI-based digital wound assessment tools that can be extended to automated measurements of other wound features or adapted to evaluate other AI-based digital image diagnostic tools. As AI-based wound assessment tools become more common across wound care settings, it will be important to rigorously validate their performance in helping clinicians obtain accurate wound assessments to guide clinical care. © 2021 American Medical Association.

This increased awareness has led to the realisation that existing legislation and regulation provides insufficient protection to individuals, groups, society, and the environment from AI harms. In response to this realisation, there has been a proliferation of principle-based ethics codes, guidelines and frameworks. However, it has become increasingly clear that a significant gap exists between the theory of AI ethics principles and the practical design of AI systems. In previous work, we analysed whether it is possible to close this gap between the ‘what’ and the ‘how’ of AI ethics through the use of tools and methods designed to help AI developers, engineers, and designers translate principles into practice. We concluded that this method of closure is currently ineffective as almost all existing translational tools and methods are either too flexible (and thus vulnerable to ethics washing) or too strict (unresponsive to context). This raised the question: if, even with technical guidance, AI ethics is challenging to embed in the process of algorithmic design, is the entire pro-ethical design endeavour rendered futile? And, if no, then how can AI ethics be made useful for AI practitioners? This is the question we seek to address here by exploring why principles and technical translational tools are still needed even if they are limited, and how these limitations can be potentially overcome by providing theoretical grounding of a concept that has been termed ‘Ethics as a Service.’ © 2021, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85108377488"

Methods: A data set of 785 2D breast ultrasound images acquired from 367 females. The DenseNet-121 was used to classify whether the lesion is benign or malignant. For performance assessment, classification results are evaluated by calculating accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic for experiments of both coarse and fine regions of interest (ROIs). The area under the curve (AUC) was evaluated, and the true-positive, false-positive, true-negative, and false-negative results with breakdown in high, medium, and low resemblance on test sets were also reported. Results: The two models with coarse and fine ROIs of ultrasound images as input achieve an AUC of 0.899 and 0.869, respectively. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the model with coarse ROIs are 88.4%, 87.9%, and 89.2%, and with fine ROIs are 86.1%, 87.9%, and 83.8%, respectively. The DL model captures ROE with high resemblance of physicians’ consideration as they assess the image. Conclusions: We have demonstrated the effectiveness of using DenseNet to classify breast lesions with limited quantity of 2D grayscale ultrasound image data. We have also proposed a new ROE-based metric system that can help physicians and patients better understand how AI makes decisions in reading images, which can potentially be integrated as a part of evidence in early screening or triaging of patients undergoing breast ultrasound examinations. Key Points: • The two models with coarse and fine ROIs of ultrasound images as input achieve an AUC of 0.899 and 0.869, respectively. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the model with coarse ROIs are 88.4%, 87.9%, and 89.2%, and with fine ROIs are 86.1%, 87.9%, and 83.8%, respectively. • The first model with coarse ROIs is slightly better than the second model with fine ROIs according to these evaluation metrics. • The results from coarse ROI and fine ROI are consistent and the peripheral tissue is also an impact factor in breast lesion classification. © 2021, European Society of Radiology.","2-s2.0-85099061647"

This study assessed the capability of an artificial intelligence (AI) system to predict multiple LVLs from images that had not been stained with iodine as well as patients at high risk for esophageal cancer. Methods We constructed the AI system by preparing a training set of 6634 images from white-light and narrow-band imaging in 595 patients before they underwent endoscopic examination with iodine staining. Diagnostic performance was evaluated on an independent validation dataset (667 images from 72 patients) and compared with that of 10 experienced endoscopists. Results The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the AI system to predict multiple LVLs were 84.4%, 70.0%, and 76.4%, respectively, compared with 46.9%, 77.5%, and 63.9%, respectively, for the endoscopists. The AI system had significantly higher sensitivity than 9/10 experienced endoscopists. We also identified six endoscopic findings that were significantly more frequent in patients with multiple LVLs; however, the AI system had greater sensitivity than these findings for the prediction of multiple LVLs. Moreover, patients with AI-predicted multiple LVLs had significantly more cancers in the esophagus and head and neck than patients without predicted multiple LVLs. Conclusion The AI system could predict multiple LVLs with high sensitivity from images without iodine staining. The system could enable endoscopists to apply iodine staining more judiciously. © 2021.

We sought to derive predictive computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to facilitate accurate diagnosis and risk stratification of IPMNs. Methods: A post hoc analysis of a single-center prospective study evaluating EUS-nCLE (2015-2019; INDEX study) was conducted using 15,027 video frames from 35 consecutive patients with histopathologically proven IPMNs (18 with HGD-Ca). We designed 2 CAD-convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms: (1) a guided segmentation-based model (SBM), where the CNN-AI system was trained to detect and measure papillary epithelial thickness and darkness (indicative of cellular and nuclear stratification), and (2) a reasonably agnostic holistic-based model (HBM) where the CNN-AI system automatically extracted nCLE features for risk stratification. For the detection of HGD-Ca in IPMNs, the diagnostic performance of the CNN-CAD algorithms was compared with that of the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and revised Fukuoka guidelines. Results: Compared with the guidelines, both n-CLE-guided CNN-CAD algorithms yielded higher sensitivity (HBM, 83.3%; SBM, 83.3%; AGA, 55.6%; Fukuoka, 55.6%) and accuracy (SBM, 82.9%; HBM, 85.7%; AGA, 68.6%; Fukuoka, 74.3%) for diagnosing HGD-Ca, with comparable specificity (SBM, 82.4%; HBM, 88.2%; AGA, 82.4%; Fukuoka, 94.1%). Both CNN-CAD algorithms, the guided (SBM) and agnostic (HBM) models, were comparable in risk stratifying IPMNs. Conclusion: EUS-nCLE-based CNN-CAD algorithms can accurately risk stratify IPMNs. Future multicenter validation studies and AI model improvements could enhance the accuracy and fully automatize the process for real-time interpretation. © 2021 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy","2-s2.0-85101296525"

Artificial intelligence (AI) attempts to reflect advanced human intelligence in machines, and efforts to develop AI systems have been made since the advent of computers. In the 1980s, an expert system that expressed expert knowledge in a program produced useful results as AI technology. However, because it was a system in which rules were embedded in advance, it was limited by its difficulty in handling exceptions. Furthermore, making rules is time-consuming. The importance of machine learning that inductively learns general rules and laws based on various events (data) became recognized in the 1990s. Machine learning techniques can be said to be general-purpose techniques for detecting regularity and specificity in observational data. In this chapter, we will introduce several AI systems that have been used to derive orthodontic diagnoses and develop treatment plans in the past. We will then introduce a newly developed AI system that uses natural language processing to conduct various clinical text evaluations and develop accompanying treatment protocols. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

This LTL framework is important as many pharmaceuticals are not administered for a patient's lifetime and as clinical trials typically involve LTL exposures. While there has been regulatory caution about applying LTL concepts to cohort of concern (COC) impurities such as N-nitrosamines, ICH M7 does not preclude this and indeed literature data suggests that the LTL framework will be protective of patient safety for N-nitrosamines. The goal was to investigate if applying the LTL framework in ICH M7 would control exposure to an acceptable excess cancer risk in humans. Using N-nitrosodiethylamine as a case study, empirical data correlating exposure duration (as a percentage of lifespan) and cancer incidence in rodent bioassays indicate that the LTL acceptable intake (AI) as derived using the ICH M7 framework would not exceed a negligible additional risk of cancer. Therefore, controlling N-nitrosamines to an LTL AI based on the ICH M7 framework is thus demonstrated to be protective for potential carcinogenic risk to patients over the exposure durations typical of clinical trials and many prescribed medicines. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","2-s2.0-85104336206"

Design Systematic review of test accuracy studies. Data sources Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 1 January 2010 to 17 May 2021. Eligibility criteria Studies reporting test accuracy of AI algorithms, alone or in combination with radiologists, to detect cancer in women's digital mammograms in screening practice, or in test sets. Reference standard was biopsy with histology or follow-up (for screen negative women). Outcomes included test accuracy and cancer type detected. Study selection and synthesis Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion and assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the QUality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. A single reviewer extracted data, which were checked by a second reviewer. Narrative data synthesis was performed. Results Twelve studies totalling 131 822 screened women were included. No prospective studies measuring test accuracy of AI in screening practice were found. Studies were of poor methodological quality. Three retrospective studies compared AI systems with the clinical decisions of the original radiologist, including 79 910 women, of whom 1878 had screen detected cancer or interval cancer within 12 months of screening. Thirty four (94%) of 36 AI systems evaluated in these studies were less accurate than a single radiologist, and all were less accurate than consensus of two or more radiologists. Five smaller studies (1086 women, 520 cancers) at high risk of bias and low generalisability to the clinical context reported that all five evaluated AI systems (as standalone to replace radiologist or as a reader aid) were more accurate than a single radiologist reading a test set in the laboratory. In three studies, AI used for triage screened out 53%, 45%, and 50% of women at low risk but also 10%, 4%, and 0% of cancers detected by radiologists. Conclusions Current evidence for AI does not yet allow judgement of its accuracy in breast cancer screening programmes, and it is unclear where on the clinical pathway AI might be of most benefit. AI systems are not sufficiently specific to replace radiologist double reading in screening programmes. Promising results in smaller studies are not replicated in larger studies. Prospective studies are required to measure the effect of AI in clinical practice. Such studies will require clear stopping rules to ensure that AI does not reduce programme specificity.

Traditional skin cancer diagnosis methods are costly, require a professional physician, and take time. Hence, to aid in diagnosing skin cancer, artificial intelligence (AI) tools are being used, including shallow and deep machine learning-based methodologies that are trained to detect and classify skin cancer using computer algorithms and deep neural networks. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify and group the different types of AI-based technologies used to detect and classify skin cancer. The study also examined the reliability of the selected papers by studying the correlation between the data set size and the number of diagnostic classes with the performance metrics used to evaluate the models. Methods: We conducted a systematic search for papers using Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library (ACM DL), and Ovid MEDLINE databases following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The studies included in this scoping review had to fulfill several selection criteria: being specifically about skin cancer, detecting or classifying skin cancer, and using AI technologies. Study selection and data extraction were independently conducted by two reviewers. Extracted data were narratively synthesized, where studies were grouped based on the diagnostic AI techniques and their evaluation metrics. Results: We retrieved 906 papers from the 3 databases, of which 53 were eligible for this review. Shallow AI-based techniques were used in 14 studies, and deep AI-based techniques were used in 39 studies. The studies used up to 11 evaluation metrics to assess the proposed models, where 39 studies used accuracy as the primary evaluation metric. Overall, studies that used smaller data sets reported higher accuracy. Conclusions: This paper examined multiple AI-based skin cancer detection models. However, a direct comparison between methods was hindered by the varied use of different evaluation metrics and image types. Performance scores were affected by factors such as data set size, number of diagnostic classes, and techniques. Hence, the reliability of shallow and deep models with higher accuracy scores was questionable since they were trained and tested on relatively small data sets of a few diagnostic classes. © Abdulrahman Takiddin, Jens Schneider, Yin Yang, Alaa Abd-Alrazaq, Mowafa Househ.

The ability of AI to deliver on its promises, however, depends on successfully resolving the ethical and practical issues identified, including that of explainability and algorithmic bias. Even though such issues might appear as being merely practical or technical ones, their closer examination uncovers questions of value, fairness and trust. It should not be left to AI developers, being research institutions or global tech companies, to decide how to resolve these ethical questions. Particularly, relying only on the trustworthiness of companies and institutions to address ethical issues relating to justice, fairness and health equality would be unsuitable and unwise. The pathway to a fair, appropriate and relevant AI necessitates the development, and critically, successful implementation of national and international rules and regulations that define the parameters and set the boundaries of operation and engagement. © 2021","2-s2.0-85114913490"

International guidelines strongly recommend that a lead trial be performed before any permanent implantation. Recent clinical data highlight some major limitations of this approach. First, it appears that patient outco mes, with or without lead trial, are similar. In contrast, during trialing, infection rate drops drastically within time and can compromise the therapy. Using composite pain assessment experience and previous research, we hypothesized that machine learning models could be robust screening tools and reliable predictors of long-term SCS efficacy. We developed several algorithms including logistic regression, regularized logistic regression (RLR), naive Bayes classifier, artificial neural networks, random forest and gradient-boosted trees to test this hypothesis and to perform internal and external validations, the objective being to confront model predictions with lead trial results using a 1-year composite outcome from 103 patients. While almost all models have demonstrated superiority on lead trialing, the RLR model appears to represent the best compromise between complexity and interpretability in the prediction of SCS efficacy. These results underscore the need to use AI-based predictive medicine, as a synergistic mathematical approach, aimed at helping implanters to optimize their clinical choices on daily practice. © 2021 by the authors.

An important domain that strives to achieve social sustainability is e-Health, and more recently e-Health mobile apps.A wealth of e-Health mobile apps is available for many purposes, such as lifestyle improvement and mental coaching. The interventions, prompts, and encouragements of e-Health apps sometimes take context into account (e.g., previous interactions or geographical location of the user), but they still tend to be rigid, e.g., apps use fixed sets of rules or they are not sufficiently tailored toward individuals' needs. Personalization to the different users' characteristics and run-time adaptation to their changing needs and context provide a great opportunity for getting users continuously engaged and active, eventually leading to better physical and mental conditions. This chapter presents a reference architecture for enabling AI-based personalization and self-adaptation of mobile apps for e-Health. The reference architecture makes use of a dedicated goal model and multiple MAPE loops operating at different levels of granularity and for different purposes. The proposed reference architecture is instantiated in the context of a fitness-based mobile application and exemplified through a series of typical usage scenarios extracted from our industrial collaborations. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

The novel virus inflames the lungs similarly to Pneumonia, making it challenging to diagnose. Currently, the common standard to diagnose the virus's presence from an individual is using a molecular real-time Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) test from fluids acquired through nasal swabs. Such a test is difficult to acquire in most underdeveloped countries with a few experts that can perform the test. As a substitute, the widely available Chest X-Ray (CXR) became an alternative to rule out the virus. However, such a method does not come easy as the virus still possesses unknown characteristics that even experienced radiologists and other medical experts find difficult to diagnose through CXRs. Several studies have recently used computer-aided methods to automate and improve such diagnosis of CXRs through Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on computer vision and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN), which some require heavy processing costs and other tedious methods to produce. Therefore, this work proposed the Fused-DenseNet-Tiny, a lightweight DCNN model based on a densely connected neural network (DenseNet) truncated and concatenated. The model trained to learn CXR features based on transfer learning, partial layer freezing, and feature fusion. Upon evaluation, the proposed model achieved a remarkable 97.99 % accuracy, with only 1.2 million parameters and a shorter end-to-end structure. It has also shown better performance than some existing studies and other massive state-of-the-art models that diagnosed COVID-19 from CXRs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85103685033"

Autonomous systems employ artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, specifically for environmental per-ception. Engineers cannot completely test or formally verify AI-based autonomous systems. The accuracy of AI-based systems depends on the quality of training data. Thus, novelty detection, that is, identifying data that differ in some respect from the data used for training, becomes a safety measure for system development and operation. In this study, we propose a new architecture for autoencoder-based semantic novelty detection with two innovations: architectural guidelines for a semantic autoencoder topology and a semantic error calculation as novelty criteria. We demonstrate that such a semantic novelty detection outperforms autoencoder-based novelty detection approaches known from the literature by minimizing false negatives. © 2021 by the authors.

These techniques are implementable with little domain knowledge. This, combined with the difficulty of testing AI systems with traditional methods, has made system trustworthiness a pressing issue. Objective: This paper studies the methods used to validate practical AI systems reported in the literature. Our goal is to classify and describe the methods that are used in realistic settings to ensure the dependability of AI systems. Method: A systematic literature review resulted in 90 papers. Systems presented in the papers were analysed based on their domain, task, complexity, and applied validation methods. Results: The validation methods were synthesized into a taxonomy consisting of trial, simulation, model-centred validation, and expert opinion. Failure monitors, safety channels, redundancy, voting, and input and output restrictions are methods used to continuously validate the systems after deployment. Conclusions: Our results clarify existing strategies applied to validation. They form a basis for the synthesization, assessment, and refinement of AI system validation in research and guidelines for validating individual systems in practice. While various validation strategies have all been relatively widely applied, only few studies report on continuous validation. © 2021 The Author(s)","2-s2.0-85112415717"

Yet, Africa faces numerous challenges in the availability, analyses, and use of data to inform health decision-making. Countries have limited access to their population data. Those with access, struggle to utilize these data for program improvements. Owing to the rapid growth of mobile phone ownership and use in the region, Africa is poised to leverage AI technologies to increase the adoption, access and use of data for health. To discuss and propose solutions for responsible development and adoption of innovations like AI in Africa, a virtual workshop was organized from the 21st to 24th June, 2021. This report highlights critical policy dimensions of strengthening digital health ecosystems by high-level policymakers, technical experts, academia, public and private sector partners. Method: The four days’ workshop focused on nine sessions, with each session focusing on three themes. Discussions during the sessions concentrated on public and private sectors, the academia and multilateral organizations’ deployment of AI. These discussions expanded participants’ understanding of AI, the opportunities and challenges that exist during adoption, including the future of AI for health in the African region. Approximately 250 participants attended the workshop, including countries representatives from ministries of Health, Information and Technology, Developmental Organizations, Private Sector, Academia and Research Institutions among others. Results: The workshop resolved that governments and relevant stakeholders should collaborate to ensure that AI and digital health receive critical attention. Government ownership and leadership were identified as critical for sustainable financing and effective scale-up of AI-enabled applications in Africa. Thus, government is to ensure that key recommendations from the workshop are implemented to improve health sector development in Africa. Conclusions: The AI workshop was a good forum to deliberate important issues regarding AI for health in the African context. It was concluded that there is a need to focus on vital priorities in deploying AI in Africa: Data protection, privacy and sharing protocols; training and creating platforms for researchers; funding and business models; developing frameworks for assessing and implementing AI; organizing forums and conferences on AI; and instituting regulations, governance and ethical guidelines for AI. There is a need to adopt a health systems approach in planning for AI to reduce inefficiencies, redundancies while increasing effectiveness in the use of AI. Thus, robust collaborations and partnerships among governments and various stakeholders were identified as key. © 2021, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85119610960"

Clouds and cloud shadows significantly decrease the usability of optical satellite data, especially in agricultural applications; therefore, an accurate and reliable cloud mask is mandatory for effective EO optical data exploitation. During the last few years, image segmentation techniques have developed rapidly with the exploitation of neural network capabilities. With this perspective, the KappaMask processor using U-Net architecture was developed with the ability to generate a classification mask over northern latitudes into the following classes: Clear, cloud shadow, semitransparent cloud (thin clouds), cloud and invalid. For training, a Sentinel-2 dataset covering the Northern European terrestrial area was labelled. KappaMask provides a 10 m classification mask for Sentinel-2 Level-2A (L2A) and Level-1C (L1C) products. The total dice coefficient on the test dataset, which was not seen by the model at any stage, was 80% for KappaMask L2A and 76% for KappaMask L1C for clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent and cloud classes. A comparison with rule-based cloud mask methods was then performed on the same test dataset, where Sen2Cor reached 59% dice coefficient for clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent and cloud classes, Fmask reached 61% for clear, cloud shadow and cloud classes and Maja reached 51% for clear and cloud classes. The closest machine learning open-source cloud classification mask, S2cloudless, had a 63% dice coefficient providing only cloud and clear classes, while KappaMask L2A, with a more complex classification schema, outperformed S2cloudless by 17%. © 2021 by the authors.

Indeed, contours of copyright protection are based on the ""traditional"" creativity process paradigm, where the access to previous-even copyrighted-works and their ""use"" as source of inspiration, e.g., reading a book or contemplating a painting, is outside copyright law coverage. In these cases, any ""copy"" of accessed work(s) takes place only in the brain and memory of the (human) creator. Besides, creative ""data"" contained in copyrighted works, including patterns, concepts, styles and other creative features are simple ""ideas"" that lie outside the realm of copyright protection. In our days, a new creativity paradigm is rising. AI systems may emulate several types of human behavior in terms of computational processes, among which, the creation of a big variety of artistic works. In a nutshell, machines ""learn"" how to be creative through Machine Learning, i.e., a computational learning process implying the use of specifically designed learning algorithms that employ as training material a corpus composed by thousands of existing works, such as texts, images, musical compositions and other, which may also be copyrighted. By repeated training, the machine detects creative features and patterns within the corpus of data and extracts a robust set of creation rules (model), based on which it produces a machine-generated creative output, namely, an algorithmic creation. This process could be characterized as ""algorithmic creativity."" However, machine learning is a copy-reliant technology and ""algorithmic inspiration"" involves the realization of genuine (digital) copies of any work used as training material within the algorithmic creativity process. This, in principle, triggers copyright law application and, consequently, ""inspirational"" copying of works requires-in principle-prior authorization from rightholders, unless if copyright exceptions apply. The present paper aims to assess whether ""algorithmic inspiration"" is out of monopolistic control under the current European Copyright Law and attempts to express some reflections in order to make EU copyright rules cope with the raising new creativity paradigm, without monopolizing inspiration. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","2-s2.0-85150401652"

Big Data and AI systems have enabled the implementation of the Digital Twin paradigm (introduced first in the manufacturing sector) in all the sectors of society. DEs promise to be a flexible and operative framework that allow the development of local, national, and international Digital Twins. In particular, the “Digital Twins of the Earth” may generate the actionable intelligence that is necessary to address global change challenges, facilitate the European Green transition, and contribute to realizing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda. The case of the Destination Earth initiative and system is discussed in the manuscript as an example to address the broader DE concepts. In respect to the more traditional data and information infrastructural philosophy, DE solutions present important advantages as to flexibility and viability. However, designing and implementing an effective collaborative DE is far more difficult than a traditional digital system. DEs require the definition and the governance of a metasystemic level, which is not necessary for a traditional information system. The manuscript discusses the principles, patterns, and architectural viewpoints characterizing a thriving DE supporting the generation and operation of “Digital Twins of the Earth”. The conclusions present a set of conditions, best practices, and base capabilities for building a knowledge framework, which makes use of the Digital Twin paradigm and the DE approach to support decision makers with the SDG agenda implementation. © 2021 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85107334000"

Results: Our results show that (i) established TD types, variations of them, and four new TD types (data, model, configuration, and ethics debt) are present in AI-based systems, (ii) 72 antipatterns are discussed in the literature, the majority related to data and model deficiencies, and (iii) 46 solutions have been proposed, either to address specific TD types, antipatterns, or TD in general. Conclusions: Our results can support AI professionals with reasoning about and communicating aspects of TD present in their systems. Additionally, they can serve as a foundation for future research to further our understanding of TD in AI-based systems.  © 2021 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85114832074"

However, in many applications, even outside medicine, a lack of transparency in AI applications has become increasingly problematic. This is particularly pronounced where users need to interpret the output of AI systems. Explainable AI (XAI) provides a rationale that allows users to understand why a system has produced a given output. The output can then be interpreted within a given context. One area that is in great need of XAI is that of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs). These systems support medical practitioners in their clinic decision-making and in the absence of explainability may lead to issues of under or over-reliance. Providing explanations for how recommendations are arrived at will allow practitioners to make more nuanced, and in some cases, life-saving decisions. The need for XAI in CDSS, and the medical field in general, is amplified by the need for ethical and fair decision-making and the fact that AI trained with historical data can be a reinforcement agent of historical actions and biases that should be uncovered. We performed a systematic literature review of work to-date in the application of XAI in CDSS. Tabular data processing XAI-enabled systems are the most common, while XAI-enabled CDSS for text analysis are the least common in literature. There is more interest in developers for the provision of local explanations, while there was almost a balance between post-hoc and ante-hoc explanations, as well as between model-specific and model-agnostic techniques. Studies reported benefits of the use of XAI such as the fact that it could enhance decision confidence for clinicians, or generate the hypothesis about causality, which ultimately leads to increased trustworthiness and acceptability of the system and potential for its incorporation in the clinical workflow. However, we found an overall distinct lack of application of XAI in the context of CDSS and, in particular, a lack of user studies exploring the needs of clinicians. We propose some guidelines for the implementation of XAI in CDSS and explore some opportunities, challenges, and future research needs. © 2021 by the authors.

AI research has proven to be exciting and has huge potential to augment and improve many fields. The question remains though, whether AI can be implemented successfully in the fields of medicine and healthcare. Medical practice is governed by clinical guidelines, protocols and standards in order to ensure positive outcomes for the patient. Various disciplines within medicine have increasingly adopted the use of technology such as databases and communication systems to enhance healthcare services. Currently, AI has limited adoptability in clinical use, possibly due to challenges in implementation and existence of disparity in communication between AI scientists and medical personnel. In this review, we explore the key challenges that AI researchers face in terms of persuading medical practitioners to utilize AI systems for clinical practice. Industry best practices such as the development of specific quality standards and enhancing interdisciplinarity could help to bridge the gap between computer scientists, medical practitioners and medical administrators. © 2021 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85115922639"

With the ongoing research in next-generation networking (NGN), the use of secure and reliable communication and networking is of utmost importance when dealing with users' health records and other sensitive information. Through the adaptation of artificial-intelligence-enabled NGN, the shape of healthcare systems can be altered to achieve smart and secure healthcare capable of coping with epidemics that may emerge at any given moment. In this article, we envision a cooperative and distributed healthcare framework that relies on state-of-the-art computing, communication, and intelligence capabilities, namely, federated learning, mobile edge computing, and blockchain, to enable epidemic (or suspicious infectious disease) discovery, remote monitoring, and fast health authority response. The introduced framework can also enable secure medical data exchange at the edge and between different health entities. This technique, coupled with the low latency and high bandwidth functionality of 5G and beyond networks, would enable mass surveillance, monitoring, and analysis to occur at the edge.

The invasion depth of neoplasms can be examined by an automated artificial intelligence (AI) system to determine the applicability of ESD and EMR. Methods: A deep convolutional neural network with a tumor localization branch to guide invasion depth classification was constructed on the GoogLeNet architecture. The model was trained using 7734 nonmagnified white-light colonoscopy (WLC) images supplemented by image augmentation from 657 lesions labeled with histopathologic analysis of invasion depth. An independent testing dataset consisting of 1634 WLC images from 156 lesions was used to validate the model. Results: For predicting noninvasive and superficially invasive neoplasms, the model achieved an overall accuracy of 91.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.6%-92.4%), with 91.2% sensitivity (95% CI, 88.8%-93.3%) and 91.0% specificity (95% CI, 89.0%-92.7%) at an optimal cutoff of .41 and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of .970 (95% CI, 962-.978). Inclusion of the advanced CRC data significantly increased the sensitivity in differentiating superficial neoplasms from deeply invasive early CRC to 65.3% (95% CI, 61.9%-68.8%) with an AUROC curve of .729 (95% CI, 699-.759), similar to experienced endoscopists (.691; 95% CI, 624-.758). Conclusions: We have developed an AI-enhanced attention-guided WLC system that differentiates noninvasive or superficially submucosal invasive neoplasms from deeply invasive CRC with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. © 2021 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy","2-s2.0-85108946216"

Numerous commercial solutions based on AI techniques are now available for sale, forcing radiology practices to learn how to properly assess these tools. While several guidelines describing good practices for conducting and reporting AI-based research in medicine and radiology have been published, fewer efforts have focused on recommendations addressing the key questions to consider when critically assessing AI solutions before purchase. Commercial AI solutions are typically complicated software products, for the evaluation of which many factors are to be considered. In this work, authors from academia and industry have joined efforts to propose a practical framework that will help stakeholders evaluate commercial AI solutions in radiology (the ECLAIR guidelines) and reach an informed decision. Topics to consider in the evaluation include the relevance of the solution from the point of view of each stakeholder, issues regarding performance and validation, usability and integration, regulatory and legal aspects, and financial and support services. Key Points: • Numerous commercial solutions based on artificial intelligence techniques are now available for sale, and radiology practices have to learn how to properly assess these tools. • We propose a framework focusing on practical points to consider when assessing an AI solution in medical imaging, allowing all stakeholders to conduct relevant discussions with manufacturers and reach an informed decision as to whether to purchase an AI commercial solution for imaging applications. • Topics to consider in the evaluation include the relevance of the solution from the point of view of each stakeholder, issues regarding performance and validation, usability and integration, regulatory and legal aspects, and financial and support services. © 2021, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85102199268"

The search terms skin cancer classification, deep learning, convolutional neural network (CNN), melanoma (detection), digital biomarkers, histopathology and whole slide imaging were combined. Based on the search results, only studies that considered direct comparison of AI results with clinicians and had a diagnostic classification as their main objective were included. Results: A total of 19 reader studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these, 11 CNN-based approaches addressed the classification of dermoscopic images; 6 concentrated on the classification of clinical images, whereas 2 dermatopathological studies utilised digitised histopathological whole slide images. Conclusions: All 19 included studies demonstrated superior or at least equivalent performance of CNN-based classifiers compared with clinicians. However, almost all studies were conducted in highly artificial settings based exclusively on single images of the suspicious lesions. Moreover, test sets mainly consisted of holdout images and did not represent the full range of patient populations and melanoma subtypes encountered in clinical practice. © 2021 The Author(s)","2-s2.0-85110598997"

AI systems which perform relatively simple tasks in the early stages of the development period are expected to become fully or largely autonomous in the near future. Thanks to this, AI which includes the concepts of machine learning, deep learning, and autonomy, has begun to play an important role in producing and using smart arms. However, questions about AI-Based Lethal Weapon Systems (AILWS) and attacks that can be carried out by such systems have not been fully answered under legal aspect. More particularly, it is a controversial issue who will be responsible for the actions that an AILWS has committed. In this article, we discussed whether AILWS can commit offense in the context of the Rome Statute, examined the applicable law regarding the responsibility of AILWS, and tried to assess whether these systems can be held responsible in the context of international law, crime of aggression, and individual responsibility. It is our finding that international legal rules including the Rome Statute can be applied regarding the responsibility for the act/crime of aggression caused by AILWS. However, no matter how advanced the cognitive capacity of an AI software, it will not be possible to resort to the personal responsibility of this kind of system since it has no legal personality at all. In such a case, responsibility will remain with the actors who design, produce, and use the system. Last but not least, since no AILWS software does have specific codes of conduct that can make legal and ethical reasonings for today, at the end of the study it was recommended that states and non-governmental organizations together with manifacturers should constitute the necessary ethical rules written in software programs to prevent these systems from unlawful acts and to develop mechanisms that would restrain AI from working outside human control. © 2021 The Authors","2-s2.0-85112789421"

Calliope is a virtual reality (VR) system that enables users to explore and manipulate generative design solutions in real time. Calliope accounts for the typical idle times in the generative design process by using a virtual environment to encourage parallelized and embodied data-exploration and synthesis, while maintaining a tight human-in-The-loop collaboration with the underlying algorithms.

Many governments consider contact tracing of citizens through apps installed on mobile phones as a key mechanism to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Objective: In this study, we sought to explore the suitability of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled social media analyses using Facebook and Twitter to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 contact tracing apps in the United Kingdom. Methods: We extracted and analyzed over 10,000 relevant social media posts across an 8-month period, from March 1 to October 31, 2020. We used an initial filter with COVID-19-related keywords, which were predefined as part of an open Twitter-based COVID-19 dataset. We then applied a second filter using contract tracing app-related keywords and a geographical filter. We developed and utilized a hybrid, rule-based ensemble model, combining state-of-the-art lexicon rule-based and deep learning-based approaches. Results: Overall, we observed 76% positive and 12% negative sentiments, with the majority of negative sentiments reported in the North of England. These sentiments varied over time, likely influenced by ongoing public debates around implementing app-based contact tracing by using a centralized model where data would be shared with the health service, compared with decentralized contact-tracing technology. Conclusions: Variations in sentiments corroborate with ongoing debates surrounding the information governance of health-related information. AI-enabled social media analysis of public attitudes in health care can help facilitate the implementation of effective public health campaigns. © Kathrin Cresswell, Ahsen Tahir, Zakariya Sheikh, Zain Hussain, Andrés Domínguez Hernández, Ewen Harrison, Robin Williams, Aziz Sheikh, Amir Hussain.

Here, we examine trust in AI in the context of a human-AI partnership that involves a joint decision making task for estimating levels of public speaking anxiety based on speech signals. The AI system is comprised of an explainable machine learning (ML) algorithm, that takes acoustic characteristics as input and outputs the estimate of public speaking anxiety levels, a local explanation about the most important features that contributed to the decision of each speech sample, and a global explanation about the most important features for the data overall. We analyze interactions between AI and human annotators with background in psychological sciences, and measure trust over time via the annotators' agreement with the AI model and the annotators' self-reports. We further examine factors of trust that are related to the characteristics of the human annotator and the ML algorithm. Results indicate that trust in AI depends on the openness level of the annotator and the importance level of input features. Findings from this study can provide guidelines to designing solutions that properly calibrate human trust in AI in collaborative human-AI tasks. © 2021 ACM.","2-s2.0-85118976660"

In addition to this data of any origin (image data, bio-signals, health records, machine states, ...) adequate supplementary information about the meaning encoded in the data is required. With this additional information - the semantic or knowledge - a tight relation between the raw data and the human-understandable concepts from the real world can be established. Nevertheless, as the amount of data needed to develop robust AI-based methods is strongly increasing, the assessment and acquisition of the related knowledge becomes more and more challenging. Within this work, an overview of currently available concepts of knowledge acquisition are described and evaluated. Four main groups of knowledge acquisition related to AI-based technologies have been identified. For image data mainly iconic annotation methods are used, where experienced users mark or draw depicted entities in the images and label them using predefined sets of classifications. Similarly, bio-signals are manually labelled, whereby important events along the timeline are marked. If no sufficient data is available, augmentation and simulation techniques are applied yielding data and semantics at the same time. In applications, where expensive sensors are replaced by low-cost devices, the high-grade data can be used as semantics. Finally, classic rule-based approaches are used, where human factual and procedural knowledge about the data and its context is translated into machine-understandable procedures. All these methods are depending on the involvement of human experts. To reduce this, more intelligent and hybrid approaches are needed, shifting the focus from the-human-in-the-loop to the-machine- in-the-loop.  © 2021 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.","2-s2.0-85121831767"

Studies have yet to investigate the clear application of AI technology in clinical practice or determine the added value for younger user groups. Translation of AI-based diagnostic tools can only be successful if they are accepted by potential users. Young adults as digital natives may offer the greatest potential for successful implementation of AI into clinical practice, while at the same time, representing the future generation of skin cancer screening participants. Objective: We conducted an anonymous online survey to examine how and to what extent individuals are willing to accept AI-based mobile apps for skin cancer diagnostics. We evaluated preferences and relative influences of concerns, with a focus on younger age groups. Methods: We recruited participants below 35 years of age using three social media channels. Facebook, LinkedIn, and Xing. Descriptive analysis and statistical tests were performed to evaluate participants' attitudes toward mobile apps for skin examination. We integrated an adaptive choice-based conjoint to assess participants' preferences. We evaluated potential concerns using maximum difference scaling. Results: We included 728 participants in the analysis. The majority of participants (66.5%, 484/728; 95% CI 0.631-0.699) expressed a positive attitude toward the use of AI-based apps. In particular, participants residing in big cities or small towns (P=.02) and individuals that were familiar with the use of health or fitness apps (P=.02) were significantly more open to mobile diagnostic systems. Hierarchical Bayes estimation of the preferences of participants with a positive attitude (n=484) revealed that the use of mobile apps as an assistance system was preferred. Participants ruled out app versions with an accuracy of ≤65%, apps using data storage without encryption, and systems that did not provide background information about the decision-making process. However, participants did not mind their data being used anonymously for research purposes, nor did they object to the inclusion of clinical patient information in the decision-making process. Maximum difference scaling analysis for the negative-minded participant group (n=244) showed that data security, insufficient trust in the app, and lack of personal interaction represented the dominant concerns with respect to app use. Conclusions: The majority of potential future users below 35 years of age were ready to accept AI-based diagnostic solutions for early detection of skin cancer. However, for translation into clinical practice, the participants' demands for increased transparency and explainability of AI-based tools seem to be critical. Altogether, digital natives between 18 and 24 years and between 25 and 34 years of age expressed similar preferences and concerns when compared both to each other and to results obtained by previous studies that included other age groups. © 2021 Sarah Haggenmüller, Eva Krieghoff-Henning, Tanja Jutzi, Nicole Trapp, Lennard Kiehl, Jochen Sven Utikal, Sascha Fabian, Titus Josef Brinker.","2-s2.0-85114033935"

In radiology, AI systems are rapidly evolving and show progress in guiding treatment decisions, diagnosing, localizing disease on medical images, and improving radiologists' efficiency. A critical component to deploying AI in radiology is to gain confidence in a developed system's efficacy and safety. The current gold standard approach is to conduct an analytical validation of performance on a generalization dataset from one or more institutions, followed by a clinical validation study of the system's efficacy during deployment. Clinical validation studies are time-consuming, and best practices dictate limited re-use of analytical validation data, so it is ideal to know ahead of time if a system is likely to fail analytical or clinical validation.

Conformity assessment procedures will require AI systems: (1) to be transparent, (2) not to rely decisions solely on algorithms, or (3) to include safety assurance cases in the documentation to facilitate technical audit. We are interested here in obtaining transparency in the case of machine learning (ML) applied to classification of retina conditions. High performance metrics achieved using ML has become common practice. However, in the medical domain, algorithmic decisions need to be sustained by explanations. We aim at building a support tool for ophthalmologists able to: (i) explain algorithmic decision to the human agent by automatically extracting rules from the ML learned models; (ii) include the ophthalmologist in the loop by formalising expert rules and including the expert knowledge in the argumentation machinery; (iii) build safety cases by creating assurance argument patterns for each diagnosis. Methods: For the learning task, we used a dataset consisting of 699 OCT images: 126 Normal class, 210 with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and 363 with Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). The dataset contains patients from the Ophthalmology Department of the County Emergency Hospital of Cluj-Napoca. All ethical norms and procedures, including anonymisation, have been performed. We applied three machine learning algorithms: decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). For each algorithm we automatically extract diagnosis rules. For formalising expert knowledge, we relied on the normative dataset (Invernizzi et al. in Ophthalmol Retina 2(8):808–815, 2018). For arguing between agents, we used the Jason multi-agent platform. We assume different knowledge base and reasoning capabilities for each agent. The agents have their own optical coherence tomography (OCT) images on which they apply a distinct machine learning algorithm. The learned model is used to extract diagnosis rules. With distinct learned rules, the agents engage in an argumentative process. The resolution of the debate outputs a diagnosis that is then explained to the ophthalmologist, by means of assurance cases. Results: For diagnosing the retina condition, our AI solution deals with the following three issues: first, the learned models are automatically translated into rules. These rules are then used to build an explanation by tracing the reasoning chain supporting the diagnosis. Hence, the proposed AI solution complies with the requirement that “algorithmic decision should be explained to the human agent”. Second, the decision is not solely based on ML-algorithms. The proposed architecture includes expert knowledge. The diagnosis is taken based on exchanging arguments between ML-based algorithms and expert knowledge. The conflict resolution among arguments is verbalised, so that the ophthalmologist can supervise the diagnosis. Third, the assurance cases are generated to facilitate technical audit. The assurance cases structure the evidence among various safety goals such as: machine learning methodology, transparency, or data quality. For each dimension, the auditor can check the provided evidence against the current best practices or safety standards. Conclusion: We developed a multi-agent system for retina conditions in which algorithmic decisions are sustained by explanations. The proposed tool goes behind most software in medical domain that focuses only on performance metrics. Our approach helps the technical auditor to approve software in the medical domain. Interleaving knowledge extracted from ML-models with expert knowledge is a step towards balancing the benefits of ML with explainability, aiming at engineering reliable medical applications. © 2021, Taiwanese Society of Biomedical Engineering.","2-s2.0-85114317218"

Unlike traditional AI that is programmed to follow human-made rules, machine-learning AI generates rules from data. These machine-generated rules are often unintelligible to humans. Will users feel more uncertainty about decisions governed by such rules? To what extent does rule transparency reduce uncertainty and increase users' trust? In a 2 × 3 × 2 between-subjects online experiment, 491 participants interacted with a website that was purported to be a decision-making AI system. Three factors of the AI system were manipulated: agency locus (human-made rules vs. machine-learned rules), transparency (no vs. placebic vs. real explanations), and task (detecting fake news vs. assessing personality). Results show that machine-learning AI triggered less social presence, which increased uncertainty and lowered trust. Transparency reduced uncertainty and enhanced trust, but the mechanisms for this effect differed between the two types of AI. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, most common neural cell models, including biologically plausible, such as Hodgkin–Huxley or Izhikevich, do not possess predictive dynamics on a single-cell level. Moreover, the modern rules of synaptic plasticity or interconnections weights adaptation also do not provide grounding for the ability of neurons to adapt to the ever-changing input signal intensity. While natural neuron synaptic growth is precisely controlled and restricted by protein supply and recycling, weight correction rules such as widely used STDP are efficiently unlimited in change rate and scale. The present article introduces new mechanics of interconnection between neuron firing rate homeostasis and weight change through STDP growth bounded by abstract protein reserve, controlled by the intracellular optimization algorithm. We show how these cellular dynamics help neurons filter out the intense noise signals to help neurons keep a stable firing rate. We also examine that such filtering does not affect the ability of neurons to recognize the correlated inputs in unsupervised mode. Such an approach might be used in the machine learning domain to improve the robustness of AI systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85114123043"

The spectral images in different bands were acquired using a self-made portable light-emit-ting diode (LED)-induced autofluorescence multispectral imager equipped with 365 and 405 nm excitation LEDs, emission filters with center wavelengths of 470, 505, 525, 532, 550, 595, 632, 635, and 695 nm, and a color image sensor. The spectral images of 218 healthy points in 62 healthy participants and 218 tumor points in 62 patients were collected in the ex vivo trials at China Medical University Hospital. These ex vivo trials were similar to in vivo because the spectral images of anatomical specimens were immediately acquired after the on-site tumor resection. The spectral images associated with red, blue, and green filters correlated with and without nine emission filters were quantized by four computing method, including summated intensity, the highest number of the intensity level, entropy, and fractional dimension. The combination of four computing methods, two excitation light sources with two intensities, and 30 spectral bands in three experiments formed 264 classifiers. The quantized data in each classifier was divided into two groups: one was the training group optimizing the threshold of the quantized data, and the other was validating group tested under this optimized threshold. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of each classifier were de-rived from these tests. To identify the influential spectral bands based on the area under the region and the testing results, a single-layer network learning process was used. This was compared to conventional rules-based approaches to show its superior and faster performance. Consequently, four emission filters with the center wavelengths of 470, 505, 532, and 550 nm were selected by an AI-based method and verified using a rule-based approach. The sensitivities of six classifiers using these emission filters were more significant than 90%. The average sensitivity of these was about 96.15%, the average specificity was approximately 69.55%, and the average accuracy was about 82.85%. © 2021 by the authors.

However, implementing AI ethics in practice remains a challenge for organizations. Various guidelines have been published to aid companies in doing so, but these have not seen widespread adoption and may feel impractical. In this technical briefing, we discuss how to implement AI ethics. We showcase a method developed for this purpose, ECCOLA, which is based on academic research.

These single sensor systems have been unable to distinguish between true and false presence of fire, such as a smoke from a cigarette which might cause the fire alarm to go off. Consuming energy all day long and being dependent on one sensor that might end with false alert is not efficient and environmentally friendly. We need a system that is efficient not only in sensing fire accurately, but we also need a solution which is smart. In order to improve upon the results of existing single sensor systems, our system uses a combination of three sensors to increase the efficiency. The result from the sensor is then analyzed by a specified rule-set using an AI-based fuzzy logic algorithm; defined in the purposed research, our system detects the presence of fire. Our system is designed to make smart decisions based on the situation; it provides feature updated alerts and hardware controls such as enabling a mechanism to start ventilation if the fire is causing suffocation, and also providing water support to minimize the damage. The purposed system keeps updating the management about the current severity of the environment by continually sensing any change in the environment during fire. The purposed system proved to provide accurate results in the entire 15 test performed around different intensities of a fire situation.

AI is increasingly being deployed across multiple domains. In response, a plethora of ethical guidelines and principles for general AI use have been published, with some convergence about which ethical concepts are relevant to this new technology. However, few of these frameworks are healthcare-specific, and there has been limited examination of actual AI applications in healthcare. Our ethical evaluation identifies context- and case-specific healthcare ethical issues for two applications, and investigates the extent to which the general ethical principles for AI-assisted healthcare expressed in existing frameworks capture what is most ethically relevant from the perspective of healthcare ethics. We provide a detailed description and analysis of two AI-based systems for clinical decision support (Painchek® and IDx-DR). Our results identify ethical challenges associated with potentially deceptive promissory claims, lack of patient and public involvement in healthcare AI development and deployment, and lack of attention to the impact of AIs on healthcare relationships. Our analysis also highlights the close connection between evaluation and technical development and reporting. Critical appraisal frameworks for healthcare AIs should include explicit ethical evaluation with benchmarks. However, each application will require scrutiny across the AI life-cycle to identify ethical issues specific to healthcare.

Studies and guidelines have emerged both for and against the use of imaging as a frontline tool to investigate such patients. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is suggested as the backbone of diagnosis. We designed and tested a diagnostic algorithm using artificial intelligence (AI) to determine the role of imaging in the evaluation of patients with acute flu-like presentation. Materials and Methods Overall, 3,235 consecutive patients with flu-like presentation were evaluated over a period of 240 days. All patients underwent plain radiographs of chest with computer-aided detection for COVID-19 (CAD4COVID) AI analysis. Based on the threshold scores, they were divided into two groups: group A (score < 50) and group B (score > 50). Group A patients were discharged and put on routine symptomatic treatment and follow-up with RT-PCR, while group B patients underwent high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) followed by COVID-19 AI analysis and RT-PCR test. These were then triaged into COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 subgroups based on COVID-19 similarity scores by AI, and lung severity scores were also determined. Results Group A had 2,209 (68.3%) patients with CAD4COVID score of <50 while 1,026 (31.7%) patients comprised group B. Also, 825 (25.5%) patients were COVID-19 positive with COVID-19 similarity threshold of >0.85 on AI. RT-PCR was positive in 415 and false-negative in 115 patients while 12 patients died before the test could be done. The sensitivity and specificity of CAD4COVID AI analysis on plain radiographs for detection of any lung abnormality combined with HRCT AI analysis was 97.9% and 99% using the above algorithm.

Materials and methods: This retrospective study included 100 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with mild (n = 23), moderate (n = 37) or severe (n = 40) pneumonia classified according to the Japanese guidelines. Univariate Kruskal–Wallis and multivariate ordinal logistic analyses were used to examine whether CT parameters (opacity score, volume of opacity, % opacity, volume of high opacity, % high opacity and mean HU total on CT) as well as blood test parameters [procalcitonin, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), C-reactive protein, % lymphocyte, ferritin, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, hemoglobin A1c, prothrombin time, activated partial prothrombin time (APTT), white blood cell count and creatinine] differed by disease severity. Results: All CT parameters and all blood test parameters except procalcitonin and APPT were significantly different among mild, moderate and severe groups. By multivariate analysis, mean HU total and eGFR were two independent factors associated with severity (p < 0.0001). Cutoff values for mean HU total and eGFR were, respectively, − 801 HU and 77 ml/min/1.73 m2 between mild and moderate pneumonia and − 704 HU and 53 ml/min/1.73 m2 between moderate and severe pneumonia.

For inspiration we look to the domain of science, where scientists have been able to develop theories which show remarkable ability to extrapolate and sometimes even predict the existence of phenomena which have never been observed before. According to David Deutsch, this type of extrapolation, which he calls “reach”, is due to scientific theories being hard to vary. In this work we investigate Deutsch's hard-to-vary principle and how it relates to more formalized principles in deep learning such as the bias-variance trade-off and Occam's razor. We distinguish internal variability, how much a model/theory can be varied internally while still yielding the same predictions, with external variability, which is how much a model must be varied to predict new, out-of-distribution data. We discuss how to measure internal variability using the notion of the Rashomon set and how to measure external variability using Kolmogorov complexity. We explore what role hard-to-vary explanations play in intelligence by looking at the human brain, the only example of highly general purpose intelligence known. We distinguish two learning systems in the brain – the first operates similar to deep learning and likely underlies most of perception while the second is a more creative system capable of generating hard-to-vary models and explanations of the world. We make contact with Popperian epistemology which suggests that the generation of scientific theories is a not an inductive process but rather an evolutionary process which proceeds through conjecture and refutation. We argue that figuring out how replicate this second system, which is capable of generating hard-to-vary explanations, is a key challenge which needs to be solved in order to realize artificial general intelligence. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85098939880"

Machine learning is one of them, and deep learning is one of those machine learning techniques. The application of AI in healthcare systems including hospitals and clinics has many possible advantages and future prospects. Applications of AI in cardiovascular medicine are machine learning techniques for diagnostic procedures including imaging modalities and biomarkers and predictive analytics for personalized therapies and improved outcomes. In cardiovascular medicine, AI-based systems have found new applications in risk prediction for cardiovascular diseases, in cardiovascular imaging, in predicting outcomes after revascularization procedures, and in newer drug targets. AI such as machine learning has partially resolved and provided possible solutions to unmet requirements in interventional cardiology. Predicting economically vital endpoints, predictive models with a wide range of health factors including comorbidities, socioeconomic factors, and angiographic factors comprising of the size of stents, the volume of contrast agent which was infused during angiography, stent malposition, and so on have been possible owing to machine learning and AI. Nowadays, machine learning techniques might possibly help in the identification of patients at risk, with higher morbidity and mortality following acute coronary syndrome (ACS). AI through machine learning has shown several potential benefits in patients with ACS. From diagnosis to treatment effects to predicting adverse events and mortality in patients with ACS, machine learning should find an essential place in clinical medicine and in interventional cardiology for the treatment and management of patients with ACS.

Recovery strategies such as remanufacturing enable durable parts and cores to be restored to their original functionality and performance, thereby minimising the consumption of virgin materials and energy required for the production of new parts and components. To date, the repair and restoration processes concerning those parts and cores that can be remanufactured involved conventional methods such as material overlay and welding. These conventional methods are highly dependent on skilled manual labour or specialised industrial robots. With the notable growth in the global remanufacturing industry, it is imperative to deploy highly-efficient and sustainable methods to automate repair and restoration. Recent trends in remanufacturing repair and restoration indicate an increasing interest in metal additive manufacturing technology. To enhance the additive manufacturing efficiency for automated repair and restoration, it is crucial to optimise the core design. This paper provides a comprehensive and comparative outline of remanufacturing repair and restoration, using both conventional and automated methods. This paper also presents and discusses comprehensive insight into the application of AI-based techniques for design optimisation specific to additive manufacturing repair. Component design optimisation is crucial due to its impact on process efficiency and the life cycle of components. The review indicates that, despite the increasing interest in using additive manufacturing for repair and restoration, reports on the application of AI for design optimisation specific to repair and restoration using additive manufacturing remain limited. Furthermore, there are no established guidelines concerning design for repair and restoration using additive manufacturing. The paper concludes with recommendations for further research and presents a future outlook on AI-based optimisation for component design to facilitate repair and restoration using additive manufacturing. Automation is expected to facilitate the removal of roadblocks specific to process inefficiency and human limitations during conventional repair and restoration in remanufacturing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85102116211"

With the advance of AI-based decisions, the role of the decision-makers is changing. The automation might result in fully automated decisions, humans-in-the-loop or AI might only be used as recommender systems in which humans have the discretion to deviate from the suggested decision. The predictability of and the accountability of the decisions might vary in these circumstances, although humans always remain accountable. Hence, there is a need for human-control and the decision-makers should be given sufficient authority to control the system and deal with undesired outcomes.

Numerous ST protocols provide high reliability and energy efficiency in normal wireless conditions, for a large variety of traffic requirements. Recently, with the EWSN dependability competitions, the community pushed ST to harsher and highly-interfered environments, improving upon classical ST protocols through the use of custom rules, hand-tailored parameters, and additional retransmissions. The results are sophisticated protocols, that require prior expert knowledge and extensive testing, often tuned for a specific deployment and envisioned scenario. In this paper, we explore how ST protocols can benefit from self-adaptivity; a self-adaptive ST protocol selects itself its best parameters to (1) tackle external environment dynamics and (2) adapt to its topology over time. We introduce Dimmer as a self-adaptive ST protocol. Dimmer builds on LWB and uses Reinforcement Learning to tune its parameters and match the current properties of the wireless medium. By learning how to behave from an unlabeled dataset, Dimmer adapts to different interference types and patterns, and is able to tackle previously unseen interference. With Dimmer, we explore how to efficiently design AI-based systems for constrained devices, and outline the benefits and downfalls of AI-based low-power networking. We evaluate our protocol on two deployments of resource-constrained nodes achieving 95.8 % reliability against strong, unknown WiFi interference. Our results outperform baselines such as non-adaptive ST protocols (27%) and PID controllers, and show a performance close to hand-crafted and more sophisticated solutions, such as Crystal (99 %).  © 2021 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85117123025"

These guidelines, however, rely heavily on high-level statements that provide no clear criteria for system assessment, making the effective control over systems a challenge. “Human oversight” is one of the requirements being put forward as a means to support human autonomy and agency. In this paper, we argue that human presence alone does not meet this requirement and that such a misconception may limit the use of automation where it can otherwise provide so much benefit across industries. We therefore propose the development of systems with variable autonomy—dynamically adjustable levels of autonomy—as a means of ensuring meaningful human control over an artefact by satisfying all three core values commonly advocated in ethical guidelines: accountability, responsibility, and transparency. © Copyright © 2021 Methnani, Aler Tubella, Dignum and Theodorou.","2-s2.0-85117951859"

There is room for the introduction of AI-based tools in the moderation process, such as to identify and filter out blank or noisy audios, use speech recognition to transcribe the voice messages in text, and use natural language processing techniques to extract relevant metadata from the audio transcripts. We design such tools and deploy them within a social enterprise working in India that runs several voice-based discussion forums. We present our findings in terms of the time and cost-savings made through the introduction of these tools, and describe the feedback of the moderators towards the acceptability of AI-based automation in their workflow. Our work forms a case-study in the use of AI for automation of several routine tasks, and can be especially relevant for other researchers and practitioners involved with the use of voice-based technologies in developing regions of the world. © 2021 ACM.","2-s2.0-85125849699"

For neurological disorders, this includes neurodegeneration and inflammation. Scalable imaging technology for big data in neurology is optical coherence tomography (OCT). We highlight that OCT changes observed in the retina, as a window to the brain, are small, requiring rigorous quality control pipelines. There are existing tools for this purpose. Firstly, there are human-led validated consensus quality control criteria (OSCAR-IB) for OCT. Secondly, these criteria are embedded into OCT reporting guidelines (APOSTEL). The use of the described annotation of failed OCT scans advances machine learning. This is illustrated through the present review of the advantages and disadvantages of AI-based applications to OCT data. The neurological conditions reviewed here for the use of big data include Alzheimer disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease, and epilepsy. It is noted that while big data is relevant for AI, ownership is complex. For this reason, we also reached out to involve representatives from patient organizations and the public domain in addition to clinical and research centers. The evidence reviewed can be grouped in a five-point expansion of the OSCAR-IB criteria to embrace AI (OSCAR-AI). The review concludes by specific recommendations on how this can be achieved practically and in compliance with existing guidelines. © 2021 The Authors.

We argue that legal syllogisms are not merely analytic logical inference rules but involve ampliative analogical inference.

For each ethics rule, a value called scaled ethics value (SEV) is used to indicate its ethical desirability. In order to model flexibility in ethical response, the authors employ the concept of ethics modes that selectively allow scenarios depending on the value of SEV. The method offers a viable mechanism for smart devices to imbue ethical sensitivity that can pave the way for a technology society amenable to human ethics. However, the method does not account for varying ethics, as such incorporating learning mechanisms represent a promising research direction. Copyright © 2021, IGI Global.","2-s2.0-85106929047"

Compared with rule-based systems, however, these systems are less transparent and their errors less predictable. Much research currently aims to improve AI technologies and debates their societal implications. Surprisingly little effort is spent on understanding the cognitive challenges of decision augmentation with AI-based systems although these systems make it more difficult for decision makers to evaluate the correctness of system advice and to decide whether to reject or accept it. As little is known about the cognitive mechanisms that underlie such evaluations, we take an inductive approach to understand how AI advice influences physicians' decision-making process. We conducted experiments with a total of 68 novice and 12 experienced physicians who diagnosed patient cases with an AI-based system that provided both correct and incorrect advice. Based on qualitative data from think-aloud protocols, interviews, and questionnaires, we elicit five decision-making patterns and develop a process model of medical diagnosis decision augmentation with AI advice. We show that physicians use second-order cognitive processes, namely metacognitions, to monitor and control their reasoning while assessing AI advice. These metacognitions determine whether physicians are able to reap the full benefits of AI or not. Specifically, wrong diagnostic decisions often result from shortcomings in utilizing metacognitions related to decision makers' own reasoning (self-monitoring) and metacognitions related to the AI-based system (system monitoring). As a result, physicians fall for decisions based on beliefs rather than actual data or engage in unsuitably superficial information search. Our findings provide a first perspective on the metacognitive mechanisms that decision makers use to evaluate system advice. Overall, our study sheds light on an overlooked facet of decision augmentation with AI, namely, the crucial role of human actors in compensating for technological errors.

In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of AI-based PU techniques in InSAR. We survey the AI-based single-baseline (SB) PU methods and then review the AI techniques related to multibaseline (MB) PU. In addition, we show several experimental examples of these methods, from both simulated and real InSAR data sets, which gives readers an overview of AI-based PU processing's potential and limitations.

Yet the discourse of Explainable AI (XAI) has been predominantly focused on algorithm-centered approaches, suffering from gaps in meeting user needs and exacerbating issues of algorithmic opacity. To address these issues, researchers have called for human-centered approaches to XAI. There is a need to chart the domain and shape the discourse of XAI with reflective discussions from diverse stakeholders. The goal of this workshop is to examine how human-centered perspectives in XAI can be operationalized at the conceptual, methodological, and technical levels. Encouraging holistic (historical, sociological, and technical) approaches, we put an emphasis on ""operationalizing"", aiming to produce actionable frameworks, transferable evaluation methods, concrete design guidelines, and articulate a coordinated research agenda for XAI. © 2021 Owner/Author.","2-s2.0-85105803279"

Even a minor accident that could have been treated as a simple injury can lead to a serious accident or death, depending on when and where it occurred. Currently, methods for tracking worker behavior to manage such construction safety accidents are being studied. However, applying the methods to the construction site, various additional elements (e.g., sensors, transmitters, wearing equipment, and control systems) that must be additionally installed and managed are required. The cost of installation and management of these factors increases in proportion to the size of the site and the number of targets to be managed. In addition, the application of new equipment and new rules lowers the work efficiency of workers. In this paper, the following contents are described: (1) system overview, (2) image processing-QR code-based safety management target recognition methodology, and (3) object location discrimination technique applying the geometric transformation.

In this paper, we introduce a risk modeling approach tailored to Collaborative AI systems. The risk model includes goals, risk events and domain specific indicators that potentially expose humans to hazards. The risk model is then leveraged to drive assurance methods that feed in turn the risk model through insights extracted from run-time evidence.

This paper deals with the practical implementation of deep learning methods for increasing safety and security in a specific ITS scenario: railway crossings. This research work presents our proposed system called Artificial Intelligence-based Surveillance System for Railway Crossing Traffic (AISS4RCT) that is based on a combination of detection and classification methods focusing on various image processing inputs: vehicle presence, pedestrian presence, vehicle trajectory tracking, railway barriers at railway crossings, railway warnings, and light signaling systems. The designed system uses cameras that are suitably positioned to capture an entire crossing area at a given railway crossing. By employing GPU accelerated image processing techniques and deep neural networks, the system autonomously detects risky and dangerous situations at railway crossing in real-time. In addition, camera modules send data to a central server for further processing as well as notification to interested parties (police, emergency services, railway operators). Furthermore, the system architecture employs privacy-by-design and security-by-design best practices in order to secure all communication interfaces, protect personal data, and to increase personal privacy, i.e., pedestrians, drivers. Finally, we present field-based results of detection methods, and using the YOLO tiny model method we achieve average recall 89%. The results indicate that our system is efficient for evaluating the occurrence of objects and situations, and it's practicality for use in railway crossings.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85106748785"

Therefore, it is important to determine the trustworthiness of these ML models and tasks. A key component in this determination is the development of task specific datasets, metrics, and best practices which are able to measure the various aspects of responsible model development and deployment including robustness, interpretability and fairness. Further, datasets are also key when training for a given task, be it coreference resolution in language modeling or facial recognition in computer vision. Imbalances and inadequate representation in datasets can have repercussions of an undesirable nature. Some common examples include how coreference resolution systems in NLU are often not all gender inclusive, discrepancies in the measurement of how robust and trustworthy machine predictions are in domains where the selective labels problem is prevalent, and discriminatory determination of pain or care levels of people belonging to different demographics in health science applications. Development of task specific datasets which do better in this regard is also extremely vital. In this workshop, we invite contributions towards different (i) datasets which help enhance task performance and inclusivity, (ii) measures and metrics which help in determining the trustworthiness of a model/dataset, (iii) assessment or remediation tools for fairer, more transparent, robust, and reliable models, and (iv) case studies describing responsible development and deployment of AI systems across fields such as healthcare, financial services, insurance, etc. The datasets, measures, mitigation techniques, and best practices could focus on different areas including (but not restricted to) the following: Fairness and Bias Robustness Reliability and Safety Interpretability Explainability Ethical AI Causal Inference Counterfactual Example Analysis They could also be focussed on the applications in diverse fields such as industry, finance, healthcare and beyond.

A wide range of methods and approaches to extract rules and related approaches to develop explainable artificial intelligence (AI) systems are considered. The taxonomy and several directions in studies of explainable neural networks related to the extraction of rules from neural networks, which allow the user to get an idea of how the neural network uses the input data, and also, using rules, to reveal the hidden relationships of the input data and the results found, are explored. This review focuses on the relationship of the most common rule-based explanation systems in AI with the most powerful machine learning algorithms using neural networks. In addition to rule extraction, other methods of constructing explainable AI systems are considered based on the construction of special modules that interpret each step of changing the neural network’s weights. A comprehensive analysis of the existing research makes it possible to draw conclusions about the appropriateness of using certain approaches. The results of the analysis will allow us to get a detailed picture of the state of research in this area and create our own applications based on neural networks, the results of which can be studied in detail and their reliability evaluated.

However, there is a lack of evidence about a comprehensive knowledge synthesis that could shed light on AI systems tested or implemented in CBPHC. Objective: We intended to identify and evaluate published studies that have tested or implemented AI in CBPHC settings. Methods: We conducted a systematic scoping review informed by an earlier study and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review framework and reported the findings according to PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis-Scoping Reviews) reporting guidelines. An information specialist performed a comprehensive search from the date of inception until February 2020, in seven bibliographic databases: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ScienceDirect, and IEEE Xplore. The selected studies considered all populations who provide and receive care in CBPHC settings, AI interventions that had been implemented, tested, or both, and assessed outcomes related to patients, health care providers, or CBPHC systems. Risk of bias was assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of the identified records, read the selected full texts, and extracted data from the included studies using a validated extraction form. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, and if this was not possible, the opinion of a third reviewer was sought. A third reviewer also validated all the extracted data. Results: We retrieved 22,113 documents. After the removal of duplicates, 16,870 documents were screened, and 90 peer-reviewed publications met our inclusion criteria. Machine learning (ML) (41/90, 45%), natural language processing (NLP) (24/90, 27%), and expert systems (17/90, 19%) were the most commonly studied AI interventions. These were primarily implemented for diagnosis, detection, or surveillance purposes. Neural networks (ie, convolutional neural networks and abductive networks) demonstrated the highest accuracy, considering the given database for the given clinical task. The risk of bias in diagnosis or prognosis studies was the lowest in the participant category (4/49, 4%) and the highest in the outcome category (22/49, 45%). Conclusions: We observed variabilities in reporting the participants, types of AI methods, analyses, and outcomes, and highlighted the large gap in the effective development and implementation of AI in CBPHC.

This system was developed as a result of the limitations mentioned above being encountered in previous studies. We approached the problem from a viewpoint of knowledge engineering with the aim of modeling medical knowledge related to strokes. Using web ontology language (OWL), a standard ontology language, we developed schema-level stroke ontologies with concepts and properties based on the brain's anatomical structures, lesions, and disease related to strokes. Also, we developed an instance-level medical terms ontology that can span standard medical terms such as those in the international classification diseases (ICD), systematized nomenclature of medicine - clinical terms (SNOMED-CT), and foundational model of anatomy (FMA). The above schema ontology and instance ontology are meaningfully mapped to each other to apply layered ontology modeling techniques that separate schemas from instances. Through semantic web rule language (SWRL)-based inference, we predict lesions, diseases, and anatomical brain structural ripple effects based on the patient's current lesions and diseases. The inferred knowledge information is provided via the SPARQL protocol and RDF query language (SPARQL), a standard ontology query language. To verify the stroke medical ontology proposed in this paper, we developed an ontology-based stroke disease prediction system. This system achieved knowledge augmentation performance of 67.82% by comparing the patients' current lesions and diseases with the lesions, diseases, and areas of disability found by SWRL-based inference using actual stroke emergency data from 37 patients.  © 2021 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85115644849"

Paradoxically, IoT technologies and paradigms such as edge computing, although they have a huge potential for the digital transition towards sustainability, they are not yet contributing to the sustainable development of the IoT sector itself. In fact, such a sector has a significant carbon footprint due to the use of scarce raw materials and its energy consumption in manufacturing, operating, and recycling processes. To tackle these issues, the Green IoT (G-IoT) paradigm has emerged as a research area to reduce such carbon footprint; however, its sustainable vision collides directly with the advent of Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI), which imposes the consumption of additional energy. This article deals with this problem by exploring the different aspects that impact the design and development of Edge-AI G-IoT systems. Moreover, it presents a practical Industry 5.0 use case that illustrates the different concepts analyzed throughout the article. Specifically, the proposed scenario consists in an Industry 5.0 smart workshop that looks for improving operator safety and operation tracking. Such an application case makes use of a mist computing architecture composed of AI-enabled IoT nodes. After describing the application case, it is evaluated its energy consumption and it is analyzed the impact on the carbon footprint that it may have on different countries. Overall, this article provides guidelines that will help future developers to face the challenges that will arise when creating the next generation of Edge-AI G-IoT systems. © 2021 by the authors.

The conventional method through leaf and soil analysis to determine the dose of fertilization has many obstacles in its implementation. The availability of experts to provide advice is also not available at all times. One way to transfer knowledge to non-experts is to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the form of a dynamic expert system. The purpose of this research is to create a dynamic expert system that can provide advice and apply fertilization quickly, cheaply, accurately, and available at all times. In building this AI system, a knowledge base, working memory, inference engine, and interface are needed. The implementation of dynamic expert system development consists of four stages, namely (1) literature study, (2) laboratory analysis, (3) construction of an inference engine, and (4) interface creation. Based on the literature study that has been carried out, it is known that there are three domains of knowledge of oil palm fertilization, namely the domain of soil, plants and climate. Each of these knowledge domains consists of attributes, sub-attributes, and facts of knowledge which are then arranged in the form of mathematical rules. The relationship between the three knowledge domains is used as the basis for making fertilization rules. The result of this research is an application with Artificial Intelligence to provide information on nutritional needs according to plant age, population, production, land area and location. The application provides recommendations for the type, frequency, amount of fertilizer, and time of application.  © 2021 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85116122876"

Evidence shows that many small polyps are missed on a single colonoscopy. There has been a successful adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to tackle the issues around missed polyps and as tools to increase the adenoma detection rate (ADR). Objective: The aim of this review was to examine the diagnostic accuracy of AI-based technologies in assessing colorectal polyps. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was undertaken using the databases of Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed. Studies reporting the use of computer-aided diagnosis for polyp detection or characterization during colonoscopy were included. Independent proportions and their differences were calculated and pooled through DerSimonian and Laird random-effects modeling. Results: A total of 48 studies were included. The meta-analysis showed a significant increase in pooled polyp detection rate in patients with the use of AI for polyp detection during colonoscopy compared with patients who had standard colonoscopy (odds ratio [OR] 1.75, 95% CI 1.56-1.96; P<.001). When comparing patients undergoing colonoscopy with the use of AI to those without, there was also a significant increase in ADR (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.32-1.77; P<.001). Conclusions: With the aid of machine learning, there is potential to improve ADR and, consequently, reduce the incidence of CRC. The current generation of AI-based systems demonstrate impressive accuracy for the detection and characterization of colorectal polyps. However, this is an evolving field and before its adoption into a clinical setting, AI systems must prove worthy to patients and clinicians. © Scarlet Nazarian, Ben Glover, Hutan Ashrafian, Ara Darzi, Julian Teare.","2-s2.0-85110586575"

The aim of the document is to provide baseline guidance for radiographers working in the field of AI in education, research, clinical practice and stakeholder partnerships. The guideline is intended for use by the multi-professional clinical imaging and radiotherapy teams, including all staff, volunteers, students and learners. Methods: The format mirrored similar publications from other SCoR working groups in the past. The recommendations have been subject to a rapid period of peer, professional and patient assessment and review. Feedback was sought from a range of SoR members and advisory groups, as well as from the SoR director of professional policy, as well as from external experts. Amendments were then made in line with feedback received and a final consensus was reached. Results: AI is an innovative tool radiographers will need to engage with to ensure a safe and efficient clinical service in imaging and radiotherapy. Educational provisions will need to be proportionately adjusted by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to offer the necessary knowledge, skills and competences for diagnostic and therapeutic radiographers, to enable them to navigate a future where AI will be central to patient diagnosis and treatment pathways. Radiography-led research in AI should address key clinical challenges and enable radiographers co-design, implement and validate AI solutions. Partnerships are key in ensuring the contribution of radiographers is integrated into healthcare AI ecosystems for the benefit of the patients and service users. Conclusion: Radiography is starting to work towards a future with AI-enabled healthcare. This guidance offers some recommendations for different areas of radiography practice. There is a need to update our educational curricula, rethink our research priorities, forge new strong clinical-academic-industry partnerships to optimise clinical practice. Specific recommendations in relation to clinical practice, education, research and the forging of partnerships with key stakeholders are discussed, with potential impact on policy and practice in all these domains. These recommendations aim to serve as baseline guidance for UK radiographers. Implications for practice: This review offers the most up-to-date recommendations for clinical practitioners, researchers, academics and service users of clinical imaging and therapeutic radiography services. Radiography practice, education and research must gradually adjust to AI-enabled healthcare systems to ensure gains of AI technologies are maximised and challenges and risks are minimised. This guidance will need to be updated regularly given the fast-changing pace of AI development and innovation. © 2021","2-s2.0-85113310382"

Practice involving primarily technical tasks like software development is not aptly equipped to process and decide upon ethical considerations. Efforts to create tools and guidelines to help people working with AI development have been concentrating almost solely on the technical aspects of AI.

Not only did the bibliometric analysis identify the most influential authors, countries, institutions, sources, and documents, but it also recognized four ethical concerns associated with 12 medical issues. These ethical categories are composed of normative, meta-ethics, epistemological and medical practice. The content analysis complemented this list of ethical categories and distinguished seven more ethical categories: ethics of relationships, medico-legal concerns, ethics of robots, ethics of ambient intelligence, patients' rights, physicians’ rights, and ethics of predictive analytics. This analysis likewise identified 40 general research gaps in the literature and plausible future research strands.

This could quickly become problematic, particularly where guidance or regulations change and once-acceptable best practice becomes outdated, or where data sources are later discredited as biased or inaccurate. This paper presents a novel method for deriving a quantifiable metric capable of ranking the overall transparency of the process pipelines used to generate AI systems, such that users, auditors and other stakeholders can gain confidence that they will be able to validate and trust the data sources and contributors in the AI systems that they rely on. The methodology for calculating the metric, and the type of criteria that could be used to make judgements on the visibility of contributions to systems are evaluated through models published at ModelHub and PyTorch Hub, popular archives for sharing science resources, and is found to be helpful in driving consideration of the contributions made to generating AI systems and approaches toward effective documentation and improving transparency in machine learning assets shared within scientific communities. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","2-s2.0-85097032199"

Findings: The authors’ synthesis of the literature suggests that AI system communication for end users has five high-level goals: (1) understandability, (2) trustworthiness, (3) transparency, (4) controllability and (5) fairness. The authors identified several design recommendations, such as offering personalized and on-demand explanations and focusing on the explainability of key functionalities instead of aiming to explain the whole system. There exists multiple trade-offs in AI system explanations, and there is no single best solution that fits all cases. Research limitations/implications: Based on the synthesis, the authors provide a design framework for explaining AI systems to end users. The study contributes to the work on AI governance by suggesting guidelines on how to make AI systems more understandable, fair, trustworthy, controllable and transparent.

The proposed approach is technically feasible, lightweight, and sufficiently scalable due to the properties offered by currently available cloud platforms, and it also yields a sensible reduction in operational costs.(b)Action taken: Since well-established guidelines to address insurance digitalization use-cases requiring deep learning do not yet exist, we propose a customized data science workflow for designing and developing two prototypes that tackle: (i) sensitive data detection and anonymization and (ii) manipulation detection on claim images. We propose a six-step method that is implemented using deep convolutional neural networks in Keras and TensorFlow and is seamlessly integrable with the most frequently used cloud environments. During prototyping, different training and testing iterations were carried out, thus progressively fine-tuning detection models, up to the achievement of the desired performance.(c)Results achieved: The developed prototypes are able to (i) robustly anonymize claim images and (ii) robustly detect manipulations on claim images (robustness means that, from a statistical viewpoint, the declared performance level is preserved even in the presence of highly heterogeneous distributions of the input data). The technical realization relies on open-source software and on the availability of cloud platforms, this last both for training purposes and for scalability issues. This demonstrates the applicability of our methodology, given a reliable analysis of the available resources, including the preparation of an appropriate training dataset for the models.(d)Lessons learned: The present work demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed deep learning-based six-step methodology for image anonymization and manipulation detection purposes and discusses challenges and learnings during implementation.

We argue that the widening use of AI decision-making, including the development of autonomous systems, not only poses widely-discussed risks for human autonomy in itself, but is also the subject of a standard-setting process that is remarkably closed to effective public contestation. The implications of this turn in governance for democratic decision-making in Britain have also yet to be fully appreciated. As the governance of AI gathers pace, one of the major tasks will be ensure not only that AI systems are technically ‘explainable’ but that, in a fuller sense, the relevant standards and rules are contestable and that governing institutions and processes are open to democratic contestability. © 2020 Perry Keller","2-s2.0-85095916201"

Screening for DR is recommended in children and adolescents, but adherence is poor. Recently, autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been developed for early detection of DR and have been included in the American Diabetes Association’s guidelines for screening in adults. We sought to determine the diagnostic efficacy of autonomous AI for the diabetic eye exam in youth with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this prospective study, point-of-care diabetic eye exam was implemented using a nonmydriatic fundus camera with an autonomous AI system for detection of DR in a multidisciplinary pediatric diabetes center. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnosability of AI was compared with consensus grading by retinal specialists, who were masked to AI output. Adherence to screening guidelines was measured before and after AI implementation. RESULTS Three hundred ten youth with diabetes aged 5–21 years were included, of whom 4.2% had DR. Diagnosability of AI was 97.5% (302 of 310). The sensitivity and specificity of AI to detect more-than-mild DR was 85.7% (95% CI 42.1–99.6%) and 79.3% (74.3–83.8%), respectively, compared with the reference standard as defined by retina specialists. Adherence improved from 49% to 95% after AI implementation. CONCLUSIONS Use of a nonmydriatic fundus camera with autonomous AI was safe and effective for the diabetic eye exam in youth in our study. Adherence to screening guidelines improved with AI implementation. As the prevalence of diabetes increases in youth and adherence to screening guidelines remains suboptimal, effective strategies for diabetic eye exams in this population are needed. © 2021 by the American Diabetes Association.","2-s2.0-85102213791"

To rank the performance of HPC AI systems, we present a new metric named Valid FLOPS, emphasizing both throughput performance and target quality. The evaluations show our methodology, benchmarks, and metrics can measure and rank the HPC AI systems in a simple, affordable and repeatable way.

The infection is caused by a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and clinically characterized by common symptoms including fever, dry cough, loss of taste/smell, myalgia and pneumonia in severe cases. With overwhelming spikes in infection and death, its pathogenesis yet remains elusive. Since the infection spread rapidly, its healthcare demands are overwhelming with uncontrollable emergencies. Although laboratory testing and analysis are developing at an enormous pace, the high momentum of severe cases demand more rapid strategies for initial screening and patient stratification. Several molecular biomarkers like C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL6), eosinophils and cytokines, and artificial intelligence (AI) based screening approaches have been developed by various studies to assist this vast medical demand. This review is an attempt to collate the outcomes of such studies, thus highlighting the utility of AI in rapid screening of molecular markers along with chest X-rays and other COVID-19 symptoms to enable faster diagnosis and patient stratification. By doing so, we also found that molecular markers such as C-reactive protein, IL-6 eosinophils, etc. showed significant differences between severe and non-severe cases of COVID-19 patients. CT findings in the lungs also showed different patterns like lung consolidation significantly higher in patients with poor recovery and lung lesions and fibrosis being higher in patients with good recovery. Thus, from these evidences we perceive that an initial rapid screening using integrated AI approach could be a way forward in efficient patient stratification. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85103196368"

There is a significant amount of research into the ethical consequences of artificial intelligence (AI). This is reflected by many outputs across academia, policy and the media. Many of these outputs aim to provide guidance to particular stakeholder groups. It has recently been shown that there is a large degree of convergence in terms of the principles upon which these guidance documents are based. Despite this convergence, it is not always clear how these principles are to be translated into practice. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors move beyond the high-level ethical principles that are common across the AI ethics guidance literature and provide a description of the normative content that is covered by these principles. The outcome is a comprehensive compilation of normative requirements arising from existing guidance documents. This is not only required for a deeper theoretical understanding of AI ethics discussions but also for the creation of practical and implementable guidance for developers and users of AI. Findings: In this paper, the authors therefore provide a detailed explanation of the normative implications of existing AI ethics guidelines but directed towards developers and organisational users of AI. The authors believe that the paper provides the most comprehensive account of ethical requirements in AI currently available, which is of interest not only to the research and policy communities engaged in the topic but also to the user communities that require guidance when developing or deploying AI systems. Originality/value: The authors believe that they have managed to compile the most comprehensive document collecting existing guidance which can guide practical action but will hopefully also support the consolidation of the guidelines landscape. The authors’ findings should also be of academic interest and inspire philosophical research on the consistency and justification of the various normative statements that can be found in the literature. © 2020, Mark Ryan and Bernd Carsten Stahl.","2-s2.0-85086091728"

Discussion on its utilisation in rehabilitation and therapy work has gradually begun. Our study looks at homecare and re-ablement of older people, where many new technologies are already actively used, but the debate over the use of AI is still limited. Objective: Both the nature of AI and the application of its use, especially in situations involving vulnerable people, raise ethical issues in the debate. We discuss opportunities and challenges that arise when applying AI to rehabilitation processes and particularly to occupational therapy. The aim is to shed light on how AI can be implemented in an ethically sustainable way. As re-ablement services usually employ occupational therapists as members of the rehabilitation team for older people, we chose the Occupational Therapy Intervention Process Model as an example of a customer-oriented process model for the rehabilitation implementation. Method: Based on the content analysis of nine interviews and 22 scientific articles, perceptions of opportunities and challenges related to AI utilisation were studied and the results were linked to the occupational therapy intervention process. Results: Opportunities enabled by AI for rehabilitation were identified, and they include clinical decision support, workload optimisation, intervention planning, remote monitoring of home rehabilitation, and the use of AI-based rehabilitation. Most of the AI challenges related to social trust and the experience of autonomy, power structures, privacy concerns, data security, transparency, and biases leading to unfair treatment of individuals and patient groups. Conclusion: Creating new competence, building and maintaining the trust, and leading the cultural change were considered key issues in AI utilisation. Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI set out the key ethical principles, but leave much room for interpretation for the implementation of ethical AI in rehabilitation. Deliberation of the ethical impacts of AI requires discussion of values and attitudes, broad citizen involvement, motivation, training for both professionals and citizens, knowledge building through trusted networks, and multi-professional collaboration. © 2021.

As a potential solution, we envision an online infrastructure that can enable large-scale, remote data contributions from disability communities. We investigate the motivations, concerns, and challenges that people with disabilities might experience when asked to collect and upload various forms of AI-relevant data through a semi-structured interview and an online survey that simulated a data contribution process by collecting example data files through an online portal.

It is known to be very complicated and volatile. Technical analysis is the observation of past market movements with the aim of predicting future prices and dealing with the effects of market movements. A trading system is based on technical indicators derived from technical analysis. In our work, a complete trading system with a combination of trading rules on Forex time series data is developed and made available to the scientific community. The system is implemented in two phases: In the first phase, each trading rule, both the AI-based rule and the trading rules from the technical indicators, is tested for selection; in the second phase, profitable rules are selected among the qualified rules and combined. Training data is used in the training phase of the trading system. The proposed trading system was extensively trained and tested on historical data from 2010 to 2021. To determine the effectiveness of the proposed method, we also conducted experiments with datasets and methodologies used in recent work by Hernandez-Aguila et al., 2021 and by Munkhdalai et al., 2019. Our method outperforms all other methodologies for almost all Forex markets, with an average percentage gain of 20.2%.

This article addresses this gap by identifying seven ethical factors that are essential for future AI4SG initiatives. The analysis is supported by 27 case examples of AI4SG projects. Some of these factors are almost entirely novel to AI, while the significance of other factors is heightened by the use of AI. From each of these factors, corresponding best practices are formulated which, subject to context and balance, may serve as preliminary guidelines to ensure that well-designed AI is more likely to serve the social good. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85118772324"

Meanwhile, the continuously improving capabilities of various artificial intelligence (AI) based systems have led to the use of AI in an increasing amount of politically significant settings. AI is now also used in official government decision-making processes, and the political significance of using AI in the political system is the topic of this chapter. The purpose is to examine the potential for AI in official political settings, distinguishing between five types of AI used to support, assist, alleviate, augment or supplant decision makers. The chapter explores the practical and theoretical potential for AI applications in politics, and the main contribution of the chapter is the development of a typology that can guide the evaluation of the impacts of such applications.

This paper (The work of the second author was partially supported by NSERC, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada. We are very grateful for the feedback from the anonymous Referees of the original submission. Their input significantly improved the quality of this final version.) presents some novel schemes for the last of the three areas. There have been thousands of papers written regarding the algorithms themselves, and the hardware vendors are scrambling for the market share. However, the question of how to store, manage and access data, which has been central to the field of Computer Science, is even more pertinent in these days when megabytes of data are being generated every second. This paper considers the problem of minimizing the cost of retrieval using the most fundamental data structure, i.e., a Singly-Linked List (SLL). We consider a SLL in which the elements are accessed by a Non-stationary Environment (NSE) exhibiting the so-called “Locality of Reference”. We propose a solution to the problem by designing an “Adaptive” Data Structure (ADS), which is created by utilizing a composite of hierarchical data “sub”-structures to constitute the overall data structure (In this paper, the primitive data structure is the SLL. However, these concepts can be extended to more complicated data structures.). In this paper, we design hierarchical Lists-on-Lists (LOLs) by assembling a SLL into a hierarchical scheme that results in SLLs on SLLs (SLLs-on-SLLs) comprising of an outer-list and sublist contexts. The goal is that elements that are more likely to be accessed together are grouped within the same sub-context, while the sublists themselves are moved “en masse” towards the head of the list-context to minimize the overall access cost. This move is carried out by employing the “de-facto” list re-organization schemes, i.e., the Move-To-Front (MTF) and Transposition (TR) rules. To achieve the clustering of elements within the sublists, we invoke the Object Migration Automaton (OMA) family of reinforcement schemes from the theory of Learning Automata (LA). They capture the probabilistic dependence of the elements in the data structure, receiving query accesses from the Environment. We show that SLLs-on-SLLs augmented with the Enhanced OMA (EOMA) minimizes the retrieval cost for elements in NSEs, and are superior to the stand-alone MTF and TR schemes, and also superior to the OMA-augmented SLLs-on-SLLs operating in such Environments. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85079428578"

Intelligent automation technologies have a strong potential to automate routine work and to balance resource use across safety risk management and other pharmacovigilance activities. While emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) show great promise for improving pharmacovigilance with their capability to learn based on data inputs, existing validation guidelines should be augmented to verify intelligent automation systems. While the underlying validation requirements largely remain the same, additional activities tailored to intelligent automation are needed to document evidence that the system is fit for purpose. We propose three categories of intelligent automation systems, ranging from rule-based systems to dynamic AI-based systems, and each category needs a unique validation approach. We expand on the existing good automated manufacturing practices, which outline a risk-based approach to artificially intelligent static systems.

Using AI components or micro benchmarks alone can lead to error-prone conclusions. This paper presents a methodology to attack the above challenge. We formalize a real-world application scenario as a Directed Acyclic Graph-based model and propose the rules to distill it into a permutation of essential AI and non-AI tasks, which we call a scenario benchmark. Together with seventeen industry partners, we extract nine typical scenario benchmarks. We design and implement an extensible, configurable, and flexible benchmark framework. We implement two Internet service AI scenario benchmarks based on the framework as proxies to two real-world application scenarios. We consider scenario, component, and micro benchmarks as three indispensable parts for evaluating. Our evaluation shows the advantage of our methodology against using component or micro AI benchmarks alone.

As transparency and fairness play a major role in administrative processes, explainable AI (XAI) approaches are expected to enable a proper usage of AI in public administration. In this article, we investigate the potential of XAI for the support of tax authority processes, especially the selection of tax audit target organizations. We illustrate relevant tax audit scenarios and present the potential of different XAI techniques which we currently develop in these scenarios.

Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled auditing technology not only facilitates accurate and comprehensive auditing for CPA firms, but is also a major breakthrough in auditing’s new environment. Applications of an AI-enabled auditing technique in external auditing can add to auditing efficiency, increase financial reporting accountability, ensure audit quality, and assist decision-makers in making reliable decisions. Strategies related to the adoption of an AI-enabled auditing technique by CPA firms cover the classical multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) task (i.e., several perspectives/criteria must be considered). To address this critical task, the present study proposes a fusion multiple rule-based decision making (MRDM) model that integrates rule-based technique (i.e., the fuzzy rough set theory (FRST) with ant colony optimization (ACO)) into MCDM techniques that can assist decision makers in selecting the best methods necessary to achieve the aspired goals of audit success.

However, despite the success of AI in different areas, the problem of designing AI systems that can truly mimic human cognitive capabilities such as artificial general intelligence, remains largely open. Consequently, many emerging cross-device AI applications will require a transition from traditional centralized learning systems towards large-scale distributed AI systems that can collaboratively perform multiple complex learning tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel design philosophy called democratized learning (Dem-AI) whose goal is to build large-scale distributed learning systems that rely on the self-organization of distributed learning agents that are wellconnected, but limited in learning capabilities. Correspondingly, inspired by the societal groups of humans, the specialized groups of learning agents in the proposed Dem-AI system are selforganized in a hierarchical structure to collectively perform learning tasks more efficiently. As such, the Dem-AI learning system can evolve and regulate itself based on the underlying duality of two processes which we call specialized and generalized processes. In this regard, we present a reference design as a guideline to realize future Dem-AI systems, inspired by various interdisciplinary fields. Accordingly, we introduce four underlying mechanisms in the design such as plasticity-stability transition mechanism, self-organizing hierarchical structuring, specialized learning, and generalization. Finally, we establish possible extensions and new challenges for the existing learning approaches to provide better scalable, flexible, and more powerful learning systems with the new setting of Dem-AI.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85099595631"

Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially deep learning techniques, has recently emerged as a disruptive technology to solve such challenging problems in a real-time manner. However, although promising results have been reported, practical design guidelines and performance guarantees of AI-based approaches are still missing. In this paper, we endeavor to address two fundamental questions: 1) What are the main advantages of AI-based methods compared with classical techniques; and 2) Which learning method should we choose for a given resource management task. For the first question, four advantages are identified and discussed. For the second question, optimality gap, i.e., the gap to the optimal performance, is proposed as a measure for selecting model architectures, as well as, for enabling a theoretical comparison between different AI-based approaches. Specifically, for K-user interference management problem, we theoretically show that graph neural networks (GNNs) are superior to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), and the performance gap between these two methods grows with √K. © 2021 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85120485930"

Commercial vendors and academic institutions have created AI tools for radiation oncology, but such tools have not yet been widely adopted into clinical practice. In addition, numerous discussions have prompted careful thoughts about AI's impact upon the future landscape of radiation oncology: How can we preserve innovation, creativity, and patient safety? When will AI-based tools be widely adopted into the clinic? Will the need for clinical staff be reduced? How will these devices and tools be developed and regulated? Summary: In this work, we examine how deep learning, a rapidly emerging subset of AI, fits into the broader historical context of advancements made in radiation oncology and medical physics. In addition, we examine a representative set of deep learning-based tools that are being made available for use in external beam radiotherapy treatment planning and how these deep learning-based tools and other AI-based tools will impact members of the radiation treatment planning team. Key Messages: Compared to past transformative innovations explored in this article, such as the Monte Carlo method or intensity-modulated radiotherapy, the development and adoption of deep learning-based tools is occurring at faster rates and promises to transform practices of the radiation treatment planning team. However, accessibility to these tools will be determined by each clinic's access to the internet, web-based solutions, or high-performance computing hardware. As seen by the trends exhibited by many technologies, high dependence on new technology can result in harm should the product fail in an unexpected manner, be misused by the operator, or if the mitigation to an expected failure is not adequate. Thus, the need for developers and researchers to rigorously validate deep learning-based tools, for users to understand how to operate tools appropriately, and for professional bodies to develop guidelines for their use and maintenance is essential. Given that members of the radiation treatment planning team perform many tasks that are automatable, the use of deep learning-based tools, in combination with other automated treatment planning tools, may refocus tasks performed by the treatment planning team and may potentially reduce resource-related burdens for clinics with limited resources. © 2020 S.

Asynchronous messaging is increasingly used to support human–machine inter-actions, generally implemented through chatbots. Such virtual entities assist the users in activities of different kinds (e.g., work, leisure, and health-related) and are becoming ingrained into humans’ habits due to factors including (i) the availability of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, (ii) the increasingly engaging nature of chatbot interactions, (iii) the release of dedicated APIs from messaging platforms, and (iv) increasingly complex AI-based mechanisms to power the bots’ behav-iors. Nevertheless, most of the modern chatbots rely on state machines (implementing conversational rules) and one-fits-all approaches, neglecting personalization, data-stream privacy management, multi-topic management/interconnection, and multimodal interactions. Objective. This work ad-dresses the challenges above through an agent-based framework for chatbot development named EREBOTS. Methods. The foundations of the framework are based on the implementation of (i) multi-front-end connectors and interfaces (i.e., Telegram, dedicated App, and web interface), (ii) enabling the configuration of multi-scenario behaviors (i.e., preventive physical conditioning, smoking cessa-tion, and support for breast-cancer survivors), (iii) online learning, (iv) personalized conversations and recommendations (i.e., mood boost, anti-craving persuasion, and balance-preserving physical exercises), and (v) responsive multi-device monitoring interface (i.e., doctor and admin). Results. EREBOTS has been tested in the context of physical balance preservation in social confinement times (due to the ongoing pandemic).

Computer-aided detection (CADe) systems have been developed to assist pathologists in slide assessment, increasing diagnosis efficiency and reducing misdetections. In this study, we conducted four experiments to demonstrate that the features learned by deep learning models are interpretable from a pathological perspective. In addition, classifiers such as the support vector machine (SVM) and random forests (RF) were used in experiments to replace the fully connected layers and decompose the end-to-end framework, verifying the validity of feature extraction in the convolutional layers. The experimental results reveal that the features learned from the convolutional layers work as morphological descriptors for specific cells or tissues, in agreement with the diagnostic rules in practice. Most of the properties learned by the deep learning models summarized detection rules that agree with those of experienced pathologists. The interpretability of deep features from a clinical viewpoint not only enhances the reliability of AI systems, enabling them to gain acceptance from medical experts, but also facilitates the development of deep learning frameworks for different tasks in pathological analytics.  © MYU K.K.","2-s2.0-85128715757"

Considering the other side of the coin, the eruption of technology has created situations that need more caution about the safety and security of data and systems at all levels. Thus, to hedge against the growing threats of cybersecurity, the need for a robust AI platform supported by machine learning and other supportive technologies is well recognized by organizations. AI is a much sought-after topic, and there is extolling literature available in repositories. Hence, a systematic arrangement of the literature that can help identify the right AI platform that can provide identity governance and access control is the need of the hour. Having this background, the present study is commissioned a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to accomplish the necessity. Literature related to AI and Identity and Access Management (IAM) is collected from renowned peer-reviewed digital libraries for systematic analysis and assessment purposes using the systematic review guidelines. Thus, the final list of articles relevant to the framed research questions related to the study topic is fetched and is reviewed thoroughly. For the proposed systematic research work, the literature reported during the period ranging from 2016 to 2021 (a portion of 2021 is included) is analyzed and a total of 43 papers were depicted more relevant to the selected research domain. These articles were accumulated from ProQuest, Scopus, Taylor & Franics, Science Direct, and Wiley online repositories. The article's contribution can supplement the AI-based IAM information and steer the entities of diverse sectors concerning seamless implementation.

This is most often achieved by explaining a classifier trained on cluster data with cluster labels as a dependant variable.

New XAI methods are often based on an intuitive notion what an effective explanation should be. Rule- and example-based contrastive explanations are two exemplary explanation styles. In this study we evaluate the effects of these two explanation styles on system understanding, persuasive power and task performance in the context of decision support in diabetes self-management. Furthermore, we provide three sets of recommendations based on our experience designing this evaluation to help improve future evaluations. Our results show that rule-based explanations have a small positive effect on system understanding, whereas both rule- and example-based explanations seem to persuade users in following the advice even when incorrect. Neither explanation improves task performance compared to no explanation. This can be explained by the fact that both explanation styles only provide details relevant for a single decision, not the underlying rational or causality.

However, traditional testing methods of the quality of engineering systems have difficulties supporting AI systems with machine learning (ML) based on large-scale data due to their uncertainty, non-deterministic, and vulnerability. Academic fields have studied new techniques to manage and guarantee high-quality ML components in AI systems with the importance of realizing trustworthy AI. Moreover, regulatory authorities have developed new guidelines and rules for safe and broad market adoption to control quality. Although there is a lot of effort from both sides, ML quality control and assessment pose challenges that arise from gaps between their different points of view. This paper proposes a new testbed called 'Qunomon (QUality + gNOMON)' that harmonizes gaps of two sides and supports the combination and comparison of various testing methods in ML component quality.

Being able to learn correlations or causalities enables the system to predict what future events may occur based on the currently observed events, or to know what actions can be taken to effect future consequences. This is useful for prediction and problem solving processes that are very important aspects of intelligent capabilities. However, the purported correlations or causalities are often accompanied by unrelated noisy events. The noise can intervene between the relevant events, and are termed diachronic causal or correlational noise. The noise can also occur concomitantly with the events of interest, and are termed simultaneous causal or correlational noise. While there has been previous work that addresses the issue of diachronic causal or correlational noise, simultaneous causal or correlational noise, especially in a symbolic rule learning process, has not been adequately addressed. This paper presents an algorithm to remove simultaneous causal noise in order to recover the correct causal rules involved.

In agri-food industrial systems, an artificial intelligent system would drive a system towards the set objectives based on the information and knowledge gathered from the consumers, farmers, machines, and domain experts. Machine learning (ML) is the preferred tool to process the knowledge and information for identifying some underlying rules and patterns to support the implementation of the AI based solution. ML-based AI is preferred, because the heterogeneity in consumer preference, biological variability of material characteristics, and unpredictable system behavior presents a highly complex system to be handled by the rule based expert systems. This chapter gives an insight of the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning with the emphasis on their application for AI implementation in the field of agri-food material handling.

However, the long-developed rulebased autoverfication models have limitations. Themachine learning (ML) algorithm possesses unique advantages in the evaluation of large datasets. We investigated the utility ofML algorithms for developing an artificial intelligence (AI) autoverification system to support laboratory testing. The accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm model were also validated. Methods: Testing data, including 52 testing items with demographic information, were extracted from the laboratory information system and Roche Cobas® IT 3000 from June 1, 2018 to August 30, 2019. Two rounds of modeling were conducted to train different ML algorithms and test their abilities to distinguish invalid reports. Algorithms with the top three best performances were selected to form the finalized ensemble model. Double-blind testing between experienced laboratory personnel and the AI autoverification system was conducted, and the passing rate and false-negative rate (FNR) were documented. The working efficiency and workload reduction were also analyzed. Results: The final AI system showed a 89.60% passing rate and 0.95 per mille FNR, in double-blind testing. The AI system lowered the number of invalid reports by approximately 80% compared to those evaluated by a rule-based engine, and therefore enhanced the working efficiency and reduced the workload in the biochemistry laboratory.

Drawing from structuration theory and literature on institutional trust, we offer a model of public trust in AI that differs starkly from models driving Trusted AI efforts. This model provides a theoretical scaffolding for Trusted AI research which underscores the need to develop nothing less than a comprehensive and visibly functioning regulatory ecosystem. We elaborate the pivotal role of externally auditable AI documentation within this model and the work to be done to ensure it is effective, and outline a number of actions that would promote public trust in AI. We discuss how existing efforts to develop AI documentation within organizations - -both to inform potential adopters of AI components and support the deliberations of risk and ethics review boards - -is necessary but insufficient assurance of the trustworthiness of AI. We argue that being accountable to the public in ways that earn their trust, through elaborating rules for AI and developing resources for enforcing these rules, is what will ultimately make AI trustworthy enough to be woven into the fabric of our society. © 2021 ACM.","2-s2.0-85102630302"

It mimics the biological concept “surviving of the fittest” to iteratively explore the scheduling parameter space looking for the best solution. Besides providing high-quality results, one main benefit of the proposed approach is that it enables the generation of fully automated and individually optimized schedules. Moreover, it generates schedules based on transparent rules, well-defined scientific goals and by making decisions based on Monte Carlo simulations. The improvements in terms of precision of geodetic parameters are discussed for various observing programs organized by the International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry (IVS), such as the OHG, R1, and T2 programs. In the case of schedules with a difficult telescope network, an improvement in the precision of the geodetic parameters up to 15% could be identified, as well as an increase in the number of observations of up to 10% compared to classical scheduling approaches. Due to the high quality of the produced schedules and the reduced workload for the schedulers, various IVS observing programs are already making use of the evolutionary parameter selection, such as the AUA, INT2, INT3, INT9, OHG, T2 and VGOS-B program. © 2021, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85104829107"

The paper proposes a new method for understanding the social context where CCS will be deployed based on the toolkit. In practice, the proposed method can be used to harness social data collected on the CCS project. The outcome of this application is a development of a predictive tool for gaining insight into the future, to guide strategic decisions that may enhance deployment. Methodologically, the proposed predictive tool is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool. It uses fuzzy deep neural network to develop computational ability to reason about the social behavior. The hybridization of fuzzy logic and deep neural network algorithms make the predictive tool an explainable AI system. It means that the prediction of the algorithm is interpretable using fuzzy logical rules. The practical feasibility of the proposed system has been demonstrated using an experimental sample of 198 volunteers. Their perceptions, emotions and sentiments were tested using a standard questionnaire from the literature, on a hypothetical CCS project based on 26 predictors. The generalizability of the algorithm to predict future reactions was tested on, 84 out-of-sample respondents. In the simulation experiment, we observed an approximately 90 % performance. This performance was measured when the algorithm's predictions were compared to the self- reported reactions of the out of sample subjects.

Due to the complicated yet competent nature of AI algorithms, the design and implementation of such AI-driven approaches in games are challenging and time intensive. In this regard, we propose a supervised Machine Learning (ML)-based approach that contributes in designing an innovative and less complex Tic-Tac-Toc expert system. Integrating AI and ML in the solution process will lead the concerned community toward a more lightweight and computationally efficient systems for playing games. In this study, we propose a novel algorithmic solution by combining an ensemble-based boosting approach and rule-based inference to build a probabilistic expert system that strategically chooses the best optimal move for next possible state of the game.

This study investigates the prediction accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach and a linear model. The heuristic expecting 1 day of stay per percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) serves as the performance benchmark. Methods: The study is based on pediatric burn patient's data sets from an international burn registry (N = 8,542). Mean absolute error and standard error are calculated for each prediction model (rule of thumb, linear regression, and random forest). Factors contributing to a prolonged stay and the relationship between TBSA and the residual error are analyzed. Results: The random forest-based approach and the linear model are statistically superior to the rule of thumb (p < 0.001, resp. p = 0.009). The residual error rises as TBSA increases for all methods. Factors associated with a prolonged LOS are particularly TBSA, depth of burn, and inhalation trauma. Conclusion: Applying AI-based algorithms to data from large international registries constitutes a promising tool for the purpose of prediction in medicine in the future; however, certain prerequisites concerning the underlying data sets and certain shortcomings must be considered. © Copyright © 2021 Elrod, Mohr, Wolff, Boettcher, Reinshagen, Bartels, German Burn Registry and Koenigs.","2-s2.0-85100591760"

Data catalogs therefore allow to create a single, clear, and easy-accessible interface for training and testing computational models. Despite a lively discussion among practitioners, there is little research on data catalogs.

Hagerdorff (2020) has evaluated 22 different ethical guidelines for AI. He found that in 80 per cent of the guidelines handle privacy, fairness and accountability as minimal requirements of responsible AI system. He also noted that these matters in addition to robustness and explainability are more easily solved as technical matters than the social issues that might be arising from the development of AI system. He found that the company codes of ethics were the most minimalistic which was also verified in our paper. Hagerdorff also found that the ethical guidelines usually do not commit to larger societal interests. This paper compares EC's ethical guidelines with those of IBM, Google and IEEE for getting a picture how the ethical issues are approached in commercial environment. The applied analysis method is data-driven; the ethical guidelines are examined and the common themes are noted to appear. The EC's ethical guidelines are the basis of the comparison. Noticed common themes of these guidelines are accountability, transparency and explainability, diversity, inclusion and fairness, safety and security, and societal wellbeing and humanity, even though all the themes are not discussed in all guidelines in detail. It seems that the ethical guidelines usually do not commit to larger societal interests because the societal issues and wider effects that AI has on the society are hard to write on the form of the simple guidelines. The discussion on the effects of the artificial intelligence on the societies needs to be addressed to political decision-makers and wider audience of researchers than just the developers of the AI or business organizations that exploit artificial intelligence. There is also need for involving the users and target groups to this discussion. © 2021 3rd European Conference on the Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, ECIAIR 2021.

Therefore, engineering such systems poses significant new challenges to RE. Our search showed that literature has focused on using AI to manage RE activities, with limited research on RE for AI (RE4AI). Our study's main objective was to investigate current approaches in writing requirements for AI/ML systems, identify available tools and techniques used to model requirements, and find existing challenges and limitations. We performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of current RE4AI methods and identified 27 primary studies.

Coronavirus is the influenza-like respiratory disease causing damage to the respiratory system of the humans through the ACE2 receptors which acts as an entry gate for the virus to enter. The Corona virus was identified in late 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China which later spread to the most of the territories in China. The spread was first identified by the Bluedot which is a Saas service designed to track and detect the spread of infectious disease. When the other countries came to know the severity of the virus they made various steps to prevent the spread of the virus. The initial symptoms of coronavirus are rise in temperature, loss of taste and smell and short breathness. As the entry level check many institutions and offices, checks the body temperature of the people and checks whether the person is wearing a mask or not. To make this process fully automatic without human intervention the use of AI enabled IR camera sensor with the Arduino UNO is made. The detection of temperature can be made possible by the use of the computer leveraging vision techniques which is equipped with the Raspberry-pi camera module. The process is based on the thermal imaging of the person which can detect the elevated temperature of the person and prevents them from entering into the institution or offices thereby the spread due to the possibly affected persons can be avoided thereby the spread can be controlled. The system not only identifies the person with high temperature but also checks whether the person is wearing a mask or not. The real time analysis of the system is the major advantage of the proposed system.  © 2021 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85106472308"

Initially in this chapter, a little trust is built up by setting the current digital transformation into a historical context. Examples that show the potential and risks emerging from AI-based applications are discussed. Obviously, disruption is not new and key lessons can be learnt from the past. The “digital trio” (Robot Process Automation, blockchain, and quantum/supercomputing), i.e., digital technologies surrounding and contributing to AI, is explained for non-engineers and the performance is critically reflected. Using openly accessible AI platform Kaggle, a demonstration illustrates the output dependency on both key ingredients for AI: data and algorithms. Readers can immediately recheck calculation results themselves (without any software coding skills required): Based on a test dataset, different AI algorithms are used in an early warning system. It will be shown that even slight variations in the parametrization will lead to significantly different results. Obviously, this indicates a key problem of AI applications discussed as well in Part III, as misalignment on data and algorithms will ultimately lead to biased decisions and hence discrimination. The AI world emerged with an exponential pace. While there is a broad awareness of AI potential, for the last few years there is a clear duopoly on driving the AI agenda. The technologies used, the applications derived, and the impact on individuals’ and social lives will be illustrated by contrasting the two superpowers, the USA and China, in their approach to rule in the digital age. Despite the ethical consequences of the two very different endeavors, the USA with a so-called surveillance capitalism and China with the so-called market Leninism, there are massive implications not only on the social lives but as well on resource consumption, which provokes an exponential increase in energy demand (and with that realistically an increase in CO2) as well as costs. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85163197253"

This review article focused on the application of the radiomicsrelated diagnosis of HCC using radiological imaging (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound (B-mode, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, and elastography)), and discussed the current role, limitation and future of ultrasound. Although the evidence has shown the positive effect of AI-based ultrasound in the prediction of tumor characteristics and malignant potential, posttreatment response and prognosis, there are still a number of issues in the practical management of patients with HCC.

However, the use of AI in healthcare also brings potential risks that may cause unintended harm. To guide future developments in AI, the High-Level Expert Group on AI set up by the European Commission (EC), recently published ethics guidelines for what it terms “trustworthy” AI. These guidelines are aimed at a variety of stakeholders, especially guiding practitioners toward more ethical and more robust applications of AI. In line with efforts of the EC, AI ethics scholarship focuses increasingly on converting abstract principles into actionable recommendations. However, the interpretation, relevance, and implementation of trustworthy AI depend on the domain and the context in which the AI system is used. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate how to use the general AI HLEG trustworthy AI guidelines in practice in the healthcare domain. To this end, we present a best practice of assessing the use of machine learning as a supportive tool to recognize cardiac arrest in emergency calls. The AI system under assessment is currently in use in the city of Copenhagen in Denmark. The assessment is accomplished by an independent team composed of philosophers, policy makers, social scientists, technical, legal, and medical experts. By leveraging an interdisciplinary team, we aim to expose the complex trade-offs and the necessity for such thorough human review when tackling socio-technical applications of AI in healthcare. For the assessment, we use a process to assess trustworthy AI, called 1Z-Inspection® to identify specific challenges and potential ethical trade-offs when we consider AI in practice.

Many rules and regulations have been implemented in the UAE to reduce injuries and fatalities in the jobsites. However, the number of accidents continues to increase. For instance, an accident category of fall-from-height is considered as the top cause of injuries and fatalities. Thus, this paper develops a novel technique that monitors the workers whether they are complying with a safety standard of the Personal Fall Arrest System (PFAS). This paper establishes a real time detection algorithm based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in order to detect two main components of the PFAS that are, safety harness and life-line, in addition to a standard safety measure of using a safety helmet. The YOLOv3 algorithm is adopted for a deep learning network used to train the desired model. The model achieved an accuracy rate of 91.26% and around 99% precision. Moreover, the overall recall of the model was 90.2%. The obtained results verify the effectiveness of our proposed model in construction sites to control potential violations and to avoid unnecessary accidents. The main contribution of this paper is to provide an AI-based image detection framework to mitigate the likelihood of fall-from-height accidents.  © 2013 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85121771436"

Cryptocurrency is easy to use and trade, and this ease of access into the market brought newcomers into the Crypto-trading scene. This surge of inexperienced newcomers causes market instability and major loss amongst themselves. AI models, algorithms, and systems have been long used as an important aspect of prediction. However, the use of AI systems is complex. AI tools and systems often use complicated mathematical formulas and are not easily understood. Amongst these AI systems, Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems (FRBSs) has one of the most easily understood displays. With accuracy that rivals of other less-understood methods, such as Neural Network, FRBSs present us a choice that is easily used by users while keeping the interface as basic and simple as possible. This paper aims to study the use of FRBSs using SK-MOEFS (SciKit-Multi Objective Evolutionary Fuzzy System) Python Library in predicting a bull signal or a bear signal in the Cryptocurrency market while still preserving FRBSs user-friendly nature. The fuzzy sets are partitioned as Very Low, Low, Medium, High, and Very High. Then the resulting classification are used to signal whether a Cryptocurrency is bearish or bullish on the current day.

The earliest NSS were settlement-oriented and template-based or rule-based. Then followed the development of case-based systems, which were an important extension on the use of rule-based reasoning in AI. Simultaneously, game theory was used as the basis of providing intelligent negotiation support, as shown in the Adjusted Winner, Family Winner, and Smartsettle Systems. In the early years of negotiation support using AI, systems development was often ad hoc rather than systematic, with a focus more upon technology than user needs. The situation changed as intelligent NSS were proposed for use in a variety of domains such as family law and international disputes. We conclude with a discussion of the features that a truly helpful online dispute resolution system would provide, and with comments on how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the need for online dispute resolution. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.","2-s2.0-85127795197"

Machine learning (ML), one of the first AI methods, was described in the 50s, followed recently by an extraordinary technical development of computers and processing power leading to the current achievements of deep learning (DL). DL is the current state-of-art technique in ML, particularly well adapted for image analysis. DL techniques have allowed new algorithms to make predictions on various outcomes and diagnosis, based on « learning » (training) on large datasets, using either a supervised (labelled data) or un-supervised (unlabelled data) approach. As in other areas of DL, the input data is used for training purposes and needs to be selected according to the highest clinical diagnostic standards, because it represents the « ground truth » or the « reference standard ». All the results provided by a DL algorithm will be compared to this ground truth. After the training phase, the performance of the algorithm is tested, first via internal validation (cross-validation) and, more importantly, via external testing (in totally novel datasets). The datasets used for training, internal validation and external testing need to be distinct and should not intersect at any time. The performance of an algorithm is expressed as diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiving operating curve (AUC), compared to the reference standard. The current, extraordinary boom of AI requires a high need of rigorous, controlled, prospective evaluations to demonstrate the impact of AI systems in health outcomes. In response to this need, AI consensus groups have recently elaborated international guidelines regarding AI interventions, including instructions and skills required for use of AI systems, including considerations for the handling of input and output data, the human–AI interaction and analysis of error cases [1]. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

These technologies are now actively being implemented in smartphone apps and healthcare, providing multiple healthcare services. However, several factors affect the usefulness of mobile healthcare apps, and usability is an important one. There are various healthcare apps developed for each specific task, and the success of these apps depends on their performance. This study presents a systematic review of the existing apps and discusses their usability attributes. It highlights the usability models, outlines, and guidelines proposed in previous research for designing apps with improved usability characteristics. Thirty-nine research articles were reviewed and examined to identify the usability attributes, framework, and app design conducted. The results showed that satisfaction, efficiency, and learnability are the most important usability attributes to consider when designing eHealth mobile apps.

In particular, we focus on automatically determining whether changes in ethical education influenced core moral values in humans throughout the century. We analyze ethics as taught in Japan before WWII and today to verify how much the pre-WWII moral attitudes have in common with those of contemporary Japanese, to what degree what is taught as ethics in school overlaps with the general population's understanding of ethics, as well as to verify whether a major reform of the guidelines for teaching the school subject of “ethics” at school after 1946 has changed the way common people approach core moral questions (such as those concerning the sacredness of human life). We selected textbooks used in teaching ethics at school from between 1935 and 1937, and those used in junior high schools today (2019) and analyzed what emotional and moral associations such contents generated. The analysis was performed with an automatic moral and emotional reasoning agent and based on the largest available text corpus in Japanese as well as on the resources of a Japanese digital library. As a result, we found out that, despite changes in stereotypical view on Japan's moral sentiments, especially due to historical events, past and contemporary Japanese share a similar moral evaluation of certain basic moral concepts, although there is a large discrepancy between how they perceive some actions to be beneficial to the society as a whole while at the same time being inconclusive when it comes to assessing the same action's outcome on the individual performing them and in terms of emotional consequences. Some ethical categories, assessed positively before the war, while being associated with a nationalistic trend in education have also disappeared from the scope of interest of post- war society. The findings of this study support suggestions proposed by others that the development of personal AI systems requires supplementation with moral reasoning. Moreover, the paper builds upon this idea and further suggests that AI systems need to be aware of ethics not as a constant, but as a function with a correction on historical and cultural changes in moral reasoning. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85097337309"

We review the main ethical challenges identified in the literature and distill a set of guidelines to support the ethical design and integration of AI systems in online learning environments. This should help ensure that online learning is how is meant to be: accessible, inclusive, fair, and beneficial to society. © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-85124792048"

Under the assumption that the robotics industry cannot be relied on to regulate itself, calls for government intervention within the regulatory space-national and international-have multiplied. The various approaches to regulating AI fall into two main categories. A sectoral approach looks to identify the societal risks posed by individual technologies, so that preventive or mitigating strategies can be implemented, on the assumption that the rules applicable to AI, in say the financial industry, would be very different from those relevant to heath care providers. A cross-sectoral approach, by contrast, involves the formulation of rules (whether norms adopted by industrial consensus or laws set down by governmental authority) that, as the name implies, would have application to AI-based technologies in their generality. After surveying some domestic and international initiatives that typify the two approaches, the chapter concludes with a list of 15 recommendations to guide reflection on the promotion of societally beneficial AI. © The Author(s) 2021.

When considered in the current regulatory vacuum this is problematic, as AI-enabled cyber conflict may escalate and threaten national security and international stability. This is why this article argues for the need to define regulation for state use of AI for defence purposes and calls on regional forums, such as NATO and the European Union, to revive efforts and prepare the ground for an initiative led by the United Nations. It concludes by offering three recommendations as key aspects to regulate. There are: legal boundaries that distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate targets and define proportionality of responses; promote testing strategies with allies to organize sparring exercises among allies to test AI-based defence tactics; monitor and enforce rules, a third-party authority with teeth, should rule on whether red lines, proportionality, responsible deployment or disclosure norms have been breached. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85118790036"

For the overview, two perspectives to look at bias are taken into consideration: societal and statistical. The paper explores how biases can be defined in these two perspectives and how generally they can be classified. Based on two perspectives, the paper explores three nega-tive consequences of biases in AI systems: discrimination and stigmatization (as the more societal concepts) and inaccuracy of AI’s decisions (more related to the statistical perception of bias). Each of these consequences is analyzed within the frameworks they correspond to. Recognizing inaccuracy as harm caused by biased AI systems is one of the most important contributions of the article. It is argued that once identified, bias in an AI system indicates possible inaccuracy in its outcomes. The article demonstrates it through the analysis of the medical devices framework: if it is applicable to AI applications used in genomics and ge-netics, how it defines bias, and what are the requirements to prevent them. The paper also looks at how this framework can work together with anti-discrimination and stigmatization rules, especially in the light of the upcoming general legal framework on AI. The authors conclude that all the frameworks shall be considered for fighting against bias in AI systems because they reflect different approaches to the nature of bias and thus provide a broader range of mechanisms to prevent or minimize them. © 2021, Lexxion Verlagsgesellschaft mbH.

Smart devices are becoming ubiquitous, including living and workspaces. These spaces often have very high privacy requirements, like living rooms, bedrooms or meeting rooms in office environments. Users of smart devices have security and privacy concerns regarding personal data collection, data storage and the use of such data by the devices and the providers. These concerns are aggravated by a lack of transparency by the device manufacturers. As a result, users have limited possibilities to make an informed decision due to missing information or interfaces. While this leads to limited trust regarding the security and privacy of smart devices, for most users, the practical benefit dominates. The project DAMA wants to address user's security and privacy concerns by creating transparency and regulating the smart devices in connection with the respective context (e.g. when users are alone at home or when they have visitors). For this purpose, the project is developing a “meta-assistant”, an assistant that regulates other AI-based assistants and other smart devices. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) for context detection and device regulation. The regulation processes are based on established ethical guidelines, which are adjusted to the project context. © 2021 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI). All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-85120530136"

While successful, current MCS solutions still suffer from limitations such as workers recruitment, data quality, trust, and so on, that can benefit a great deal from AI. However, the integration of AI in MCS is still at a nascent stage, thus opening various opportunities for further research. In this article, we review and discuss the integration of AI in MCS solutions, highlight its research challenges, and suggest means to address them. We also propose a novel architecture for AI-based MCS, where AI techniques are integrated and embedded in the different layers of MCS framework to provide efficient and trusted MCS applications. In particular, a machine learning (ML)-based selection using behaviors of individual workers is proposed, and its efficacy is gauged by analyzing a use-case study. The results show that by implementing a hybrid approach, the efficiency of selection was considerably improved.

However, bias prevalent in an organization’s model could create meaningful issues, ranging from incorrect hiring decisions to a negative impact on an organization’s image. Organizations often lack the knowledge or time to create a model in line with society’s standards, leading to the utilization of faulty systems. Here, we present a framework to help combat this issue, allowing organizations to prevent bias in their models. Our framework starts with a general guidebook to clarify relevant terminology and provide best practices for developers to measure and mitigate bias. We then incorporate an automated algorithm based on statistical parity and disparate impact to de-bias raw data. We apply SMOTE-Tomek to resample imbalanced datasets and a Reject Option Classification algorithm to reduce biased predictions. We infer adding more data related to minority and unprivileged classes to datasets will help create more equitable and representative datasets leading to fair AI systems for all.

This brings cutting-edge computing paradigms with embedded cognitive capabilities into vehicle domains and data infrastructure to provide holistic intrinsic and extrinsic intelligence for new mobility applications. Digital technologies are a significant enabler in achieving the sustainability goals of the green transformation of the mobility and transportation sectors. Innovation occurs predominantly in ECAS vehicles’ architecture, operations, intelligent functions, and automotive digital infrastructure. The traditional ownership model is moving toward multimodal and shared mobility services. The ECAS vehicle’s technology allows for the development of virtual automotive functions that run on shared hardware platforms with data unlocking value, and for introducing new, shared computing-based automotive features. Facilitating vehicle automation, vehicle electrification, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is accomplished by the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI), cellular/wireless connectivity, edge computing, the Internet of things (IoT), the Internet of intelligent things (IoIT), digital twins (DTs), virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). Vehicles become more intelligent, connected, functioning as edge micro servers on wheels, powered by sensors/actuators, hardware (HW), software (SW) and smart virtual functions that are integrated into the digital infrastructure. Electrification, automation, connectivity, digitalization, decarbonization, decentralization, and standardization are the main drivers that unlock intelligent vehicles' potential for sustainable green mobility applications. ECAS vehicles act as autonomous agents using swarm intelligence to communicate and exchange information, either directly or indirectly, with each other and the infrastructure, accessing independent services such as energy, high-definition maps, routes, infrastructure information, traffic lights, tolls, parking (micropayments), and finding emergent/intelligent solutions. The article gives an overview of the advances in AI technologies and applications to realize intelligent functions and optimize vehicle performance, control, and decision-making for future ECAS vehicles to support the acceleration of deployment in various mobility scenarios. ECAS vehicles, systems, sub-systems, and components are subjected to stringent regulatory frameworks, which set rigorous requirements for autonomous vehicles. An in-depth assessment of existing standards, regulations, and laws, including a thorough gap analysis, is required. Global guidelines must be provided on how to fulfill the requirements. ECAS vehicle technology trustworthiness, including AI-based HW/SW and algorithms, is necessary for developing ECAS systems across the entire automotive ecosystem. The safety and transparency of AI-based technology and the explainability of the purpose, use, benefits, and limitations of AI systems are critical for fulfilling trustworthiness requirements. The article presents ECAS vehicles’ evolution toward domain controller, zonal vehicle, and federated vehicle/edge/cloud-centric based on distributed intelligence in the vehicle and infrastructure level architectures and the role of AI techniques and methods to implement the different autonomous driving and optimization functions for sustainable green mobility.

However, those rule-based systems can cope with a limited number of abnormal situations, and are not flexible enough to adapt to different users and contextual situations. In this paper, we tackle this challenging problem by proposing a flexible AI system to recognize early symptoms of cognitive decline in smart-homes, which is able to explain the reason of predictions at a fine-grained level. Our method relies on well known clinical indicators that consider subtle and overt behavioral anomalies, as well as spatial disorientation and wandering behaviors. In order to adapt to different individuals and situations, anomalies are recognized using a collaborative approach. We experimented our approach with a large set of real world subjects, including people with MCI and people with dementia. We also implemented a dashboard to allow clinicians to inspect anomalies together with the explanations of predictions. Results show that our system's predictions are significantly correlated to the person's actual diagnosis. Moreover, a preliminary user study with clinicians suggests that the explanation capabilities of our system are useful to improve the task performance and to increase trust. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores data-driven explainable AI for supporting the diagnosis of cognitive decline. © 2020","2-s2.0-85095701881"

Algorithmic predictions have been used to determine provision of health care and social services, to allocate state resources, and to anticipate criminal behavior or activity. Further applications have been proposed to determine civil and criminal liability or to ""personalize""legal default rules. Deployment of such artificial intelligence (AI) systems has properly raised questions of algorithmic bias, fairness, transparency, and due process. But little attention has been paid to the known sociological costs of using predictive algorithms to determine legal status. A large and growing social science literature teaches the effects of ""algorithmic living,""documenting how humans interact with machine generated assessments. Many of these interactions are socially detrimental, and such corrosive effects are greatly amplified by the increasing speed and ubiquity of digitally automated algorithmic systems. In this Article I link the sociological and legal analysis of AI, highlighting the reflexive social processes that are engaged by algorithmic metrics. This Article examines these overlooked social effects of predictive legal algorithms and contributes to the literature a vital fundamental but missing critique of such analytics. Specifically, this Article shows how the problematic social effects of algorithmic legal metrics extend far beyond the concerns about accuracy that have thus far dominated critiques of such metrics. Second, it demonstrates that corrective governance mechanisms such as enhanced due process or transparency will be inadequate to remedy such corrosive effects, and that some such remedies, such as transparency, may actually exacerbate the worst effects of algorithmic governmentality. Third, the Article shows that the application of algorithmic metrics to legal decisions aggravates the latent tensions between equity and autonomy in liberal institutions, undermining democratic values in a manner and on a scale not previously experienced by human societies. Illuminating these effects casts new light on the inherent social costs of AI metrics, particularly the perverse effects of deploying algorithms in legal systems. © 2021 Dan L.

This CR contains the most statistically important boundary values of the input space as antecedent terms. The CR represents a hyper-rectangle of the input space inside which the GBT model is, very reliably, classifying all instances with the same class label as the explanandum instance. In a benchmark test using nine data sets and five competing state-of-the-art methods, gbt-HIPS offered the best trade-off between coverage (0.16–0.75) and precision (0.85–0.98). Unlike competing methods, gbt-HIPS is also demonstrably guarded against under-and over-fitting.

Indeed, increasing connectivity and symbiotic interactions between humans and intelligent machines raise significant questions for the rule of law and contemporary ethics, including the applicable rules relating to liability in case of damage arising from advanced AI. AI also encompasses a series of complex issues that cut across social, economic, public policy, technological, legal, ethical and national security boundaries. The development of AI-based autonomous systems is equally relevant in the context of military operations and on the battlefield, particularly with the use of drones and, more controversially, Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems. After outlining the legal and ethical challenges posed by this technology, this article focuses on AI systems for space operations that give rise to questions about how these interact with existing legal concepts and technical standards. This article also describes how space law is relevant and applicable to AI use in the context of space missions. The specific attributes of autonomous space systems may also require further consideration as to the traditional application of the authorization of space missions, the international responsibility of States and the liability regime in case of damage.

In this paper, we introduce an AI-based chatbot where students can instantly get daily updates of curriculum, admission for new students, tuition fees, IELTS writing task II score, etc. Our chatbot was developed by Deep Learning models, which are already integrated into the Rasa framework. We also proposed a rational pipeline for Vietnamese chatbots with our data preprocessing to obtain optimal accuracy and to avoid the overfitting of the model. Our model can detect more than fifty types of questions from users' input with an accuracy of 97.1% on test set.

One example is AI-based profiling models in public employment services (PES), which predict a jobseeker's probability of finding work and are used to segment jobseekers in groups. Profiling models hold the potential to improve identification of jobseekers at-risk of becoming long-term unemployed, but also induce discrimination. Using a recently developed AI-based profiling model of the Flemish PES, we assess to what extent AI-based profiling 'discriminates' against jobseekers of foreign origin compared to traditional rule-based profiling approaches. At a maximum level of accuracy, jobseekers of foreign origin who ultimately find a job are 2.6 times more likely to be misclassified as 'high-risk' jobseekers. We argue that it is critical that policymakers and caseworkers understand the inherent trade-offs of profiling models, and consider the limitations when integrating these models in daily operations.

Applications range from hiring and credit limit decisions, to loan and healthcare claim approvals, to criminal sentencing, and even the selective provision of information by social media companies to different groups of viewers. The increased adoption of AI, affecting so many aspects of our daily lives, highlights the potential risks around automated decision making and the need for better governance and ethical standards when deploying such systems. In response to that need, governments, states, municipalities, private sector organizations, and industry groups around the world have drafted hundreds, perhaps even thousands at this point - of new, regulatory proposals and guidelines; many already in effect and more on the way. The data-driven and often black box nature of these systems does not absolve organizations from the social responsibility or increasingly commonplace regulatory requirements to confirm they work as intended and are deployed in a responsible manner, lest they run the risk of reputational damage, regulatory fines, and/or legal action.

For AI systems to be as useful as possible, designers should understand journalists' professional values and incorporate them into their designs. We report findings from interviews with journalists to understand their perceptions of how professional values that are important to them (such as truth, impartiality and originality) might be supported and/or undermined by AI technologies.

Both the elderly and young are at the risk of sudden cardiac death at the ratio of 1-2% all around the world. Although AI technology with wearable technology is being used to detect heart diseases for quite some time now, sometimes it fails due to multiple reasons which include algorithm failure, high cost of treatment, limited battery time wearable device, data training issues, security and privacy issue in IoT, slow working of devices, poor internet or patients don't reach the hospital on time. Which gives rise to false results. Security and privacy issues in the old devices are the biggest flaws due to which old devices work slowly and the internet issues are common, it helps us to check their heart parameters anytime and anywhere in the world which reduces the hospital's workload, cost issues and to line onward. Meanwhile, these problems can be overcome by using modern models such as ECG assessment, AI-based guidelines, Visy's model which can recognize five critical diseases. A Wearable ECG patch is a very lightweight model that provides high accuracy and efficiency. These devices are trained by using a machine learning algorithm, and AI plays a prime role to detect the diseases. It helps us to check their heart parameters anytime and anywhere in the world which reduces the hospital's workload and cost issues, and the devices provide updated information as real-time data is stored online and secured with firebase authentication.

It is used for solving reliability problems that often manifest due to complexities in design, manufacturing, operating environment and system maintenance. For safety-critical applications, using a model-based development process for complex systems might not always be ideal but it is equally important to establish the robustness of the solution. The information revolution has allowed data-driven methods to diffuse within this field to construct the requisite process (or system models) to cope with the so-called big data phenomenon. This is supported by large datasets that help machine-learning models achieve impressive accuracy. AI technologies are now being integrated into many PHM related applications including aerospace, automotive, medical robots and even autonomous weapon systems. However, with such rapid growth in complexity and connectivity, a systems’ behaviour is influenced in unforeseen ways by cyberattacks, human errors, working with incorrect or incomplete models and even adversarial phenomena. Many of these models depend on the training data and how well the data represents the test data. These issues require fine-tuning and even retraining the models when there is even a small change in operating conditions or equipment. Yet, there is still ambiguity associated with their implementation, even if the learning algorithms classify accordingly. Uncertainties can lie in any part of the AI-based PHM model, including in the requirements, assumptions, or even in the data used for training and validation. These factors lead to sub-optimal solutions with an open interpretation as to why the requirements have not been met. This warrants the need for achieving a level of robustness in the implemented PHM, which is a challenging task in a machine learning solution. This article aims to present a framework for testing the robustness of AI-based PHM. It reviews some key milestones achieved in the AI research community to deal with three particular issues relevant for AI-based PHM in safety-critical applications: robustness to model errors, robustness to unknown phenomena and empirical evaluation of robustness during deployment. To deal with model errors, many techniques from probabilistic inference and robust optimisation are often used to provide some robustness guarantee metric. In the case of unknown phenomena, techniques include anomaly detection methods, using causal models, the construction of ensembles and reinforcement learning. It elicits from the authors’ work on fault diagnostics and robust optimisation via machine learning techniques to offer guidelines to the PHM research community. Finally, challenges and future directions are also examined; on how to better cope with any uncertainties as they appear during the operating life of an asset. © 2021","2-s2.0-85104159432"

From a policy perspective, the decisions find support in the fact that there is no clear consensus for AI to be recognized as an inventor, and that difficult questions would ensue if this were accepted. From a doctrinal perspective, the decisions do not rule out the patentability of AI-assisted inventions in general, as it remains possible to designate a human inventor when AI has merely facilitated the inventive process.

In particular, cutting edge computer vision technology based on deep-learning approaches has been deployed with an extraordinary degree of success. The ability to extract semantic concepts from continuous processing of video stream in real-time has led to the investigation of such solutions to enhance the operational security of critical infrastructure against intruders. Despite the success of computer vision technologies validated in a laboratory environment, there still exists several challenges that limit the deployment of these solutions in operational environment. Addressing these challenges, the paper presents a framework that integrates three main computer vision technologies namely (i) person detection; (ii) person re-identification and (iii) face recognition to enhance the operational security of critical infrastructure perimeter. The novelty of the proposed framework relies on the integration of key technical innovations that satisfies the operational requirements of critical infrastructure in using computer vision technologies. One such requirement relates to data privacy and citizen rights, following the implementation of General Data Protection Regulation across Europe for the successful adoption of video surveillance for infrastructure security. The video analytics solution proposed in the paper integrates privacy preserving technologies, high-level rule engine for threat identification and a knowledge model for escalating threat categorises to human operator. The various components of the proposed framework has been validated using commercially available graphical processing units for detecting intruders. The performance o the proposed framework has been evaluated in operational environments of the critical infrastructure.

This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there is a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI. Both guidelines were developed using a staged consensus process, involving a literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted on by an international multi-stakeholder group in a 2-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed on in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items, which were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations around the handling of input and output data, the human-AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer-reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial.  © ","2-s2.0-85090818434"

Objectives: We aim to review recent tendencies in building AI applications for medicine and foster its further development by outlining obstacles. Sub-objectives: (1) to highlight AI techniques that we have identified as key areas of AI-related research in healthcare; (2) to offer guidelines on building reliable AI-based CAD-systems for medicine; and (3) to reveal open research questions, challenges, and directions for future research. Methods: To address the tasks, we performed a systematic review of the references on the main branches of AI applications for medical purposes. We focused primarily on limitations of the reviewed studies. Conclusions: This study provides a summary of AI-related research in healthcare, it discusses the challenges and proposes open research questions for further research. Robotics has taken huge leaps in improving the healthcare services in a variety of medical sectors, including oncology and surgical interventions. In addition, robots are now replacing human assistants as they learn to become more sociable and reliable. However, there are challenges that must still be addressed to enable the use of medical robots in diagnostics and interventions. AI for medical imaging eliminates subjectivity in a visual diagnostic procedure and allows for the combining of medical imaging with clinical data, lifestyle risks and demographics. Disadvantages of AI solutions for radiology include both a lack of transparency and dedication to narrowed diagnostic questions. Designing an optimal automatic classifier should incorporate both expert knowledge on a disease and state-of-the-art computer vision techniques. AI in precision medicine and oncology allows for risk stratification due to genomics aberrations discovered on molecular testing. To summarize, AI cannot substitute a medical doctor.

Studies were selected using a strict inclusion criterion following PRISMA Guidelines. Risk of bias assessment was conducted using a tailored QUADAS-2 tool. Out of 315 records, 11 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. AI-based methods were employed for analysis of specific histological features for oral epithelial dysplasia (n = 1), oral submucous fibrosis (n = 5), oral squamous cell carcinoma (n = 4) and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (n = 1). A combination of heuristics, supervised and unsupervised learning methods were employed, including more than 10 different classification and segmentation techniques. Most studies used uni-centric datasets (range 40–270 images) comprising small sub-images within WSI with accuracy between 79 and 100%. This review provides early evidence to support the potential application of supervised machine learning methods as a diagnostic aid for some oral potentially malignant and malignant lesions; however, there is a paucity of evidence using AI for diagnosis of other head and neck pathologies. Overall, the quality of evidence is low, with most studies showing a high risk of bias which is likely to have overestimated accuracy rates.

We first develop a one-shot RL method for designing model-free optimal controllers based on a finite-time history of the inputs and the outputs. However, when the system dimension is large, this method may suffer from a long learning time. To overcome this problem, in the second half of the paper we introduce a new notion of approximation to the design, where the original set of input-output history is replaced by a much shorter set. We show that this approximation can lead to a nearly optimal controller that is based on a lower-dimensional approximant of the original system in terms of reachability and observability. We provide a guideline for determining an appropriate length of the input-output history to reduce the suboptimality gap. The dimension of the resulting suboptimal controller is far less than that of the optimal controller, thereby speeding up learning time. The learned controller, however may cause instability when implemented in the original high-dimensional system by adversely exciting the approximation error. We theoretically establish the conditions for closed-loop stability using robust control theory, followed by numerical investigations of the trade-offs between learning time, length of input/output history, and closed-loop performance. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated using examples from electric power systems, modeled by partially-observable nonlinear differential-algebraic equations. Impact Statement-Timing is a critical factor in the design and implementation of all AI-based control systems. For example, when avoiding collisions in a transportation network, or when controlling the electric power grid, control actions need to be taken just-in-time to avoid catastrophic consequences that could occur. Existing AI-based control laws have poor scalability due to the significant time needed to learn a controller on-the-fly. The problem is compounded due to constraints imposed by sensors and the limited set of measurements associated with partial observability of a plant. This paper proposes an approximation framework for large networks with such constraints, whereby the size of the controller can be projected onto a significantly lower-dimensional space, allowing orders of magnitude speed-up in learning and design time. The approach has the potential to transform AI-based control from slow models to fast ones with practical implications for any extreme-scale control application. © 2021 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85142810367"

Predictions of mutational effects using extensive artificial intelligence (AI)-based models, although accurate, remain as enigmatic as the experimental observations in terms of improving intuitions about the contributions of various factors. Inspired by Lipinski’s rules for drug-likeness, we devise simple thresholding criteria on five different descriptors such as conservation, which have so far been limited to qualitative interpretations such as high conservation implies high mutational effect. We analyze systematic deep mutational scanning data of all possible single amino acid substitutions on seven proteins (25153 mutations) to first define these thresholds and then to evaluate the scope and limits of the predictions. At this stage, the approach allows us to comment easily and with a low error rate on the subset of mutations classified as neutral or deleterious by all of the descriptors. We hope that complementary to the accurate AI predictions, these thresholding rules or their subsequent modifications will serve the purpose of codifying the knowledge about the effects of mutations. © 2020 American Chemical Society","2-s2.0-85096527993"

Such oversight will help to maintain the rule of law, to protect individual rights, and to ensure the protection of core democratic values. Nevertheless, achieving AI oversight is challenging due to the dynamic and opaque nature of such systems. Recently, in an attempt to increase oversight and accountability for AI systems, the proposed US Algorithmic Accountability Act introduced mandatory impact assessment for private entities that deploy automated decision-making systems. Impact assessment as a means to enhance oversight was likewise recently adopted under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation. Taken together, these initiatives mark the latest development in AI oversight policy. In this paper, we question the merits of impact assessment as a tool for promoting oversight of AI systems. Using the case of AI systems of content mod-eration, we highlight the strengths and weaknesses of this oversight tool and propose how to improve it. Additionally, we argue that even an improved impact assessment does not fit equally with the oversight challenge raised by different systems of AI. Especially, impact assessments might be insufficient to oversee AI systems that are deployed to achieve purposes that could be classified as public, such as making our online public sphere safer. Meaningful oversight of AI systems that impose costs on society as a whole, like AI systems of content modera-tion, cannot be pursued by mechanisms of self-assessment alone.

Accordingly, promising research activities focus on debiasing to strengthen fairness, accountability and transparency in machine learning. There is, though, a tendency to fix societal and ethical issues with technical solutions that may cause additional, wicked problems. Alternative analytical approaches are thus needed to avoid this and to comprehend how societal and ethical issues occur in AI systems. Despite various forms of bias, ultimately, risks result from eventual rule conflicts between the AI system behavior due to feature complexity and user practices with limited options for scrutiny. Hence, although different forms of bias can occur, automation is their common ground. The paper highlights the role of automation and explains why deep automation bias (DAB) is a metarisk of AI. Based on former work it elaborates the main influencing factors and develops a heuristic model for assessing DAB-related risks in AI systems. This model aims at raising problem awareness and training on the sociotechnical risks resulting from AI-based automation and contributes to improving the general explicability of AI systems beyond technical issues. © 2021 by the author.

To develop AI systems, many principles (human rights, well-being, data agency, effectiveness, transparency, accountability, awareness of misuse and competence) must be considered to ensure that the AI is trustworthy and applicable. The current computerised ECG interpretation algorithms can detect different types of heart diseases. However, there are some challenges and shortcomings that need to be addressed, such as the explainability issue and the interaction between the human and the AI for clinical decision making. These challenges create opportunities to develop a trustworthy XAI for automated ECG interpretation with a high performance and a high confidence level. This study reports a proposed XAI interface design in automatic ECG interpretation based on suggestions from previous studies and based on standard guidelines that were developed by the human computer interaction (HCI) community. New XAI interfaces should be developed in the future that facilitate more transparency of the decision logic of the algorithm which may allow users to calibrate their trust and use of the AI system. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85102652393"

The issue of spending a lot of time finding parking slots needs to be addressed. The increase of smartphones provides the space to develop smart applications enabled with AI and deep learning. This paper proposes an AI-based smart parking management system and a business model to provide a solution for both user and the owner of the parking space. Owners of the parking slots can opt for fixed or variable timeslots to make use of their parking spaces. Registered users can check the availability of the parking spaces at the destination in real-time and details of the users such as the time and vehicle details can be detected and updated automatically.

Not only AI researchers and journalists were astound-ed by its spectacular performance at generating human-like text in a wide variety of domains – there was also great astonishment in the philosophical community. David Chalmers, for example, calls OpenAI’s autoregressive language model “one of the most interesting and important AI systems ever produced” [1]. This assessment seems appropriate – not least because GPT-3 raises intricate philosophical questions, for instance: “Does the ability to generate ‘speech’ imply communicative ability?” [2] In other words, do machines that produce text or speech possess linguistic competence and qualify as speakers? More trenchantly put: Can GPT-3 speak? My paper develops a framework of human-machine communication which casts new light on the conversational capacity of GPT-3 and other AI-powered text generators.

Mainly, small businesses, healthcare, education, and government sectors have been under continuous attacks by these adversaries. Various static and dynamic analysis techniques exist, but these methods become less efficient as the malware writers continuously trick the defenders. Numerous research of ransomware with AI techniques often lack the behavioral analysis and its correlation mapping. In this work, we developed an AI-powered hybrid approach overcoming the recent challenges to detect ransomware. Specifically, we proposed a deep inspection approach for multi-level profiling of crypto-ransomware, which captures the distinct features at Dynamic link library, function call, and assembly levels. We showed how the code segments correlate at these levels for studied samples. Our hybrid multi-level analysis approach includes advanced static and dynamic methods and a novel strategy of analyzing behavioral chains with AI techniques. Moreover, association rule mining, natural language processing techniques, and machine learning classifiers are integrated for building ransomware validation and detection model. We experimented with crypto-ransomware samples (collected from VirusTotal). One of the machine learning algorithms achieved the highest accuracy of 99.72% and a false positive rate of 0.003 with two class datasets. The result exhibited that multi-level profiling can better detect ransomware samples with higher accuracy. The multi-level feature sequence can be extracted from most of the applications running in the different operating systems; therefore, we believe that our method can detect ransomware for devices on multiple platforms. We designed a prototype, AIRaD (AI-based Ransomware Detection) tool, which will allow researchers and the defenders to visualize the analysis with proper interpretation.  © 2013 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85114768095"

Classical encryption techniques have been employed to ensure the data security of the IoT network. However, high-level encryption techniques cannot be employed in IoT devices due to the limitation of resources. In addition, node security is still a challenge for network engineers. Thus, we need to explore a complete solution for IoT networks that can ensure nodes and data security.

The main aim of this paper is to study if an artificial intelligence (AI) based MPPT method, can be more efficient, stable and adaptable than a traditional MPPT method, in varying environment conditions, namely solar irradiation and/or environment temperature and also to analyze their behaviour in steady state conditions. The proposed FLC with a rule base collection of 25 rules outperformed the controller using the traditional P&O algorithm due to its adaptative step size, enabling the FLC to adapt the PV system faster to changing environment conditions, guessing the correct maximum power point (MPP) faster and achieving lower oscillations in steady state conditions, leading to higher generated energy due to lower losses both in steady state and dynamic environment conditions.

The automatic door gives access to go into or outside a building by sensing the approaching individual using sensors. However, it does not have the intuition to understand when a person is not authorized to go outside based on their age limit, for example, children. To address this problem, researchers have proposed solutions ranging from the use of fuzzy logic to rule-based approaches to make automatic doors better than the previous ones. In this study, an AI-based automatic door system is proposed, which uses a supervised machine learning approach to train classifiers using human body measurement.

The fear of failure in these systems is driving many governments to demand more explanation and accountability. Take, for example, the “Right of Explanation” rule proposed in the European Union in 2019, which gives citizens the right to demand an explanation from AI-based predictions. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an attempt to open up the “black box” and create more explainable systems which create predictive models whose results are easily understandable to humans. This paper describes an explanation model called ExplainEx which automatically generates natural language explanation for predictive models by consuming REST API provided by ExpliClas open-source web service. The classification model consists of four main decision tree algorithms including J48, Random Tree, RepTree and FURIA. The user interface was designed based on Microsoft.Net Framework programming platform. At the background is a software engine automating a seamless interaction between Expliclas API and the trained datasets, to provide natural language explanation to users. Unlike other studies, our proposed model is both a stand-alone and client-server based system capable of providing global explanations for any decision tree classifier. It supports multiple concurrent users in a client-server environment and can apply all four algorithms concurrently on a single dataset, returning both precision score and explanation. It is a ready tool for researchers who have datasets and classifiers prepared for explanation. This work bridges the gap between prediction and explanation, thereby allowing researchers to concentrate on data analysis and building state-of-the-art predictive models. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85105938022"

At the same time, further adoption in some domains is hindered by the inability to fully trust an AI system that it will not harm a human. Besides, fairness, privacy, transparency, and explainability are vital to developing trust in AI systems. As stated in Describing Trustworthy AI,aa.https://www.ibm.com/watson/trustworthy-ai. Trust comes through understanding. How AI-led decisions are made and what determining factors were included are crucial to understand. The subarea of explaining AI systems has come to be known as XAI. Multiple aspects of an AI system can be explained; these include biases that the data might have, lack of data points in a particular region of the example space, fairness of gathering the data, feature importances, etc. However, besides these, it is critical to have human-centered explanations directly related to decision-making, similar to how a domain expert makes decisions based on domain knowledge, including well-established, peer-validated explicit guidelines. To understand and validate an AI system's outcomes (such as classification, recommendations, predictions) that lead to developing trust in the AI system, it is necessary to involve explicit domain knowledge that humans understand and use. Contemporary XAI methods are yet addressed explanations that enable decision-making similar to an expert.

Children's creativity is influenced by collaborative play with creative peers through social emulation. In this paper, we study children's emulation of an AI-enabled social Non-Player Character (NPC) as a new type of game mechanism to elicit creative expression. We developed Magic Draw, a collaborative drawing game designed to foster children's figural creativity that allows us to investigate the efficacy of an NPC's creativity demonstration in enhancing children's creativity in the resulting drawings. The NPC is an emotively expressive social robot that plays Magic Draw with a child as a peer-like playmate. We present the results of a study in which participants co-draw figures with a social robot that demonstrates different levels of figural creativity, to understand whether an NPC's creativity in its own contributions stimulates figural creativity in children. 78 participants (ages 5 - 10) were randomly assigned to a non-creative robot control condition (C-) and a creative robot condition (C+). Participants who interacted with the creative robot generated significantly more creative drawings, and hence exhibited higher levels of figural creativity. We infer that the social robotic peers' demonstration of figural creativity in a collaborative drawing game is emulated by young children. We discuss a new game design principle grounded in the social learning mechanism of emulation, specifically, that social and intelligent NPCs in games should demonstrate creative behavior to foster the same in human players.  © 2020 Owner/Author.","2-s2.0-85097490664"

Purpose: To develop an artificial intelligence (AI) solution for PI-RADS classification and compare its performance with an expert radiologist using targeted biopsy results. Study Type: Retrospective study including data from our institution and the publicly available ProstateX dataset. Population: In all, 687 patients who underwent mpMRI of the prostate and had one or more detectable lesions (PI-RADS score >1) according to PI-RADSv2. Field Strength/Sequence: T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI; five evenly spaced b values between b = 0–750 s/mm2) for apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping, high b-value DWI (b = 1500 or 2000 s/mm2), and dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted series were obtained at 3.0T. Assessment: PI-RADS lesions were segmented by a radiologist. Bounding boxes around the T2/ADC/high-b value segmentations were stacked and saved as JPEGs. These images were used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN). The PI-RADS scores obtained by the CNN were compared with radiologist scores. The cancer detection rate was measured from a subset of patients who underwent biopsy. Statistical Tests: Agreement between the AI and the radiologist-driven PI-RADS scores was assessed using a kappa score, and differences between categorical variables were assessed with a Wald test. Results: For the 1034 detection lesions, the kappa score for the AI system vs. the expert radiologist was moderate, at 0.40. However, there was no significant difference in the rates of detection of clinically significant cancer for any PI-RADS score in 86 patients undergoing targeted biopsy (P = 0.4–0.6). Data Conclusion: We developed an AI system for assignment of a PI-RADS score on segmented lesions on mpMRI with moderate agreement with an expert radiologist and a similar ability to detect clinically significant cancer.

Its widespread use has been instrumental in ensuring transparency in the evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes. The CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a two-day consensus meeting (31 stakeholders), and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The CONSORT-AI extension includes 14 new items that were considered sufficiently important for AI interventions that they should be routinely reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the human–AI interaction and provision of an analysis of error cases. CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions. It will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret, and critically appraise the quality of clinical trial design and risk of bias in the reported outcomes. © 2020 The Author(s).

Deep learning is often used to recognize video characteristics but requires a huge amount of computer resources. This makes it difficult to keep track of the activities of multiple people whose circumstances change. On the other hand, many trained models of one person's motion recognition have been developed and are available. We propose to use the existing technology but to be able to do that we need to identify a single person's activities within a group context. This is achieved by segmenting the video and cropping the area with a person, identifying the activity using pre-existing trained models. The activity of the group is recognized by a production rule system based on individual activities. To achieve our goal, we introduce the concept of atomic action to describe activities and propose categories of atomic actions. High-level collaborative categories that indicate the status of a group during collaborative meetings are based on the CIAO model.

Several studies have recently shown the potential of AI-driven endoscopy for the investigation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This systematic review provides an overview of the current position and future potential of AI in IBD endoscopy. Methods: A systematic search was carried out in PubMed and Scopus up to 2 December 2020 using the following search terms: artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer-aided, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease (CD). All studies on human digestive endoscopy were included. A qualitative analysis and a narrative description were performed for each selected record according to the Joanna Briggs Institute methodologies and the PRISMA statement. Results: Of 398 identified records, 18 were ultimately included. Two-thirds of these (12/18) were published in 2020 and most were cross-sectional studies (15/18). No relevant bias at the study level was reported, although the risk of publication bias across studies cannot be ruled out at this early stage. Eleven records dealt with UC, five with CD and two with both. Most of the AI systems involved convolutional neural network, random forest and deep neural network architecture. Most studies focused on capsule endoscopy readings in CD (n = 5) and on the AI-assisted assessment of mucosal activity in UC (n = 10) for automated endoscopic scoring or real-time prediction of histological disease. Discussion: AI-assisted endoscopy in IBD is a rapidly evolving research field with promising technical results and additional benefits when tested in an experimental clinical scenario. External validation studies being conducted in large and prospective cohorts in real-life clinical scenarios will help confirm the added value of AI in assessing UC mucosal activity and in CD capsule reading. Plain language summary: Artificial intelligence for inflammatory bowel disease endoscopy Artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising technology in many areas of medicine. In recent years, AI-assisted endoscopy has been introduced into several research fields, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) endoscopy, with promising applications that have the potential to revolutionize clinical practice and gastrointestinal endoscopy. We have performed the first systematic review of AI and its application in the field of IBD and endoscopy. A formal process of paper selection and analysis resulted in the assessment of 18 records. Most of these (12/18) were published in 2020 and were cross-sectional studies (15/18). No relevant biases were reported. All studies showed positive results concerning the novel technology evaluated, so the risk of publication bias cannot be ruled out at this early stage. Eleven records dealt with UC, five with CD and two with both. Most studies focused on capsule endoscopy reading in CD patients (n = 5) and on AI-assisted assessment of mucosal activity in UC patients (n = 10) for automated endoscopic scoring and real-time prediction of histological disease. We found that AI-assisted endoscopy in IBD is a rapidly growing research field. All studies indicated promising technical results. When tested in an experimental clinical scenario, AI-assisted endoscopy showed it could potentially improve the management of patients with IBD. Confirmatory evidence from real-life clinical scenarios should be obtained to verify the added value of AI-assisted IBD endoscopy in assessing UC mucosal activity and in CD capsule reading. © The Author(s), 2021.","2-s2.0-85107805113"

Unfortunately, these systems are not flawless. Their faults, failures and other systemic issues have emphasized the urgency for consideration of ethical standards and practices in AI engineering. Despite the growing number of studies in AI ethics, comparatively little attention has been placed on how ethical issues can be mitigated in software engineering (SE) practice. Currently understanding is lacking regarding the provision of useful tools that can help companies transform high-level ethical guidelines for AI ethics into the actual workflow of developers. In this paper, we explore the idea of using user stories to transform abstract ethical requirements into tangible outcomes in Agile software development. We tested this idea by studying master’s level student projects (15 teams) developing web applications for a real industrial client over the course of five iterations. These projects resulted in 250+ user stories that were analyzed for the purposes of this paper. The teams were divided into two groups: half of the teams worked using the ECCOLA method for AI ethics in SE, while the other half, a control group, was used to compare the effectiveness of ECCOLA. Both teams were tasked with writing user stories to formulate customer needs into system requirements. Based on the data, we discuss the effectiveness of ECCOLA, and Primary Empirical Contributions (PECs) from formulating ethical user stories in Agile development. © 2021, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85111394929"

Accidents have been reported in situations where the automated driving technology was not able to function according to specifications. As data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are becoming more ubiquitous in automated vehicles, it is increasingly important to make AI systems situational aware. One aspect of this is determining whether these systems are competent in the current and immediate traffic situation, or that they should hand over control to the driver or safety system. We aim to increase the safety of automated driving functions by combining data-driven AI systems with knowledge-based AI into a hybrid-AI system that can reason about competence in the traffic state now and in the next few seconds. We showcase our method using an intention prediction algorithm that is based on a deep neural network and trained with real-world data of traffic participants performing a cut-in maneuver in front of the vehicle. This is combined with a unified, quantitative representation of the situation on the road represented by an ontology-based knowledge graph and first-order logic inference rules, that takes as input both the observations of the sensors of the automated vehicle as well as the output of the intention prediction algorithm. The knowledge graph utilises the two features of importance, based on domain knowledge, and doubt, based on the observations and information about the dataset, to reason about the competence of the intention prediction algorithm. We have applied the competence assessment of the intention prediction algorithm to two cut-in scenarios: a traffic situation that is well within the operational design domain described by the training data set, and a traffic situation that includes an unknown entity in the form of a motorcycle that was not part of the training set. In the latter case the knowledge graph correctly reasoned that the intention prediction algorithm was incapable of producing a reliable prediction. This shows that hybrid AI for situational awareness holds great promise to reduce the risk of automated driving functions in an open world containing unknowns. Automated driving is one of the most appealing applications of artificial intelligence in an open world. It holds the promise of reducing the number of casualties (1.35 million yearly (WHO 2018)), increasing the comfort of travel by taking over the driving task from humans, and bringing mobility to those unable to drive. While fleets of fully automated vehicles that can run unrestrained in an open world are still far away (Koopman and Wagner 2016), many vehicles are already equipped with Advanced Driver Assistence Systems (Okuda, Kajiwara, and Terashima 2014), like Lane Keep Assist and Adaptive Cruise Control. According to The Geneva Convention on road traffic of 1949 and the Vienna Convention on road traffic 1968, on which many countries base their national traffic laws, a human driver has to be present in the vehicle (Vellinga 2019).

Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based technologies have played a substantial role in solving complex problems, and several organizations have been swift to adopt and customize these technologies in response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature on the role of AI as a comprehensive and decisive technology to fight the COVID-19 crisis in the fields of epidemiology, diagnosis, and disease progression. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases was performed according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines to identify all potentially relevant studies published and made available online between December 1, 2019, and June 27, 2020. The search syntax was built using keywords specific to COVID-19 and AI. Results: The search strategy resulted in 419 articles published and made available online during the aforementioned period. Of these, 130 publications were selected for further analyses. These publications were classified into 3 themes based on AI applications employed to combat the COVID-19 crisis: Computational Epidemiology, Early Detection and Diagnosis, and Disease Progression. Of the 130 studies, 71 (54.6%) focused on predicting the COVID-19 outbreak, the impact of containment policies, and potential drug discoveries, which were classified under the Computational Epidemiology theme. Next, 40 of 130 (30.8%) studies that applied AI techniques to detect COVID-19 by using patients' radiological images or laboratory test results were classified under the Early Detection and Diagnosis theme. Finally, 19 of the 130 studies (14.6%) that focused on predicting disease progression, outcomes (ie, recovery and mortality), length of hospital stay, and number of days spent in the intensive care unit for patients with COVID-19 were classified under the Disease Progression theme. Conclusions: In this systematic review, we assembled studies in the current COVID-19 literature that utilized AI-based methods to provide insights into different COVID-19 themes. Our findings highlight important variables, data types, and available COVID-19 resources that can assist in facilitating clinical and translational research. © Hafsa Bareen Syeda, Mahanazuddin Syed, Kevin Wayne Sexton, Shorabuddin Syed, Salma Begum, Farhanuddin Syed, Fred Prior, Feliciano Yu Jr. ","2-s2.0-85100154476"

This document builds upon previous European initiatives such as the High-Level Expert Group’s Ethical Guidelines on artificial intelligence (‘AI’), where the concept of ‘trustworthiness’ is embedded as a key pillar and a pre-requisite for developing and deploying AI technologies. The roadmap assesses the associated ethical, safety and regulatory challenges that may arise from the deployment and use of AI applications in aviation. This article provides an overview of the main takeaways, strengths and weaknesses of this roadmap. It critically analyses the main challenges of AI-driven technologies throughout the entire aviation domain. The article argues the roadmap would benefit from considering new regulatory tools and processes, such as regulatory sandboxing and AI-driven certification, and contends any efforts for standardization of AI in aviation must be reconciled with existing standardization of automation and that this may not always be a straightforward process as far as interoperability is concerned. Finally, the article argues that further exploration of the identification and allocation of liability will be indispensable in fostering increased levels of trust in AI-enabled aviation. © 2021.

If managed well, it can significantly improve business productivity. The traditional information extraction techniques are limited in their functionality, but AI-based techniques can provide a better solution. A thorough investigation of AI-based techniques for automatic information extraction from unstructured documents is missing in the literature. The purpose of this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is to recognize, and analyze research on the techniques used for automatic information extraction from unstructured documents and to provide directions for future research. The SLR guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Charters were adhered to conduct a literature search on various databases between 2010 and 2020. We found that: 1. The existing information extraction techniques are template-based or rule-based, 2. The existing methods lack the capability to tackle complex document layouts in real-time situations such as invoices and purchase orders, 3. The datasets available publicly are task-specific and of low quality. Hence, there is a need to develop a new dataset that reflects real-world problems. Our SLR discovered that AI-based approaches have a strong potential to extract useful information from unstructured documents automatically. However, they face certain challenges in processing multiple layouts of the unstructured documents. Our SLR brings out conceptualization of a framework for construction of high-quality unstructured documents dataset with strong data validation techniques for automated information extraction. Our SLR also reveals a need for a close association between the businesses and researchers to handle various challenges of the unstructured data analysis. © 2013 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85104231001"

To take up this new challenge, research on the design of Human-Robot-Collaboration (HRC) involving AI-based systems has yet to establish common targets and guidelines. This paper presents results from an explorative qualitative study. Participants (N= 80) were either exposed to a virtual representation of an industrial robot-arm equipped with several augmentation channels for communication with the human operator (lights, textual statements about intentions, etc.) or one with no communicative functions at all. Across all conditions, participants recognized the benefit of collaborating with robots in industrial scenarios regarding work efficiency and alleviation of working conditions. However, a communication channel from the robot to the human is crucial for achieving these benefits. Participants interacting with the non-communicative robot expressed dissatisfaction about the workflow. In both conditions we found remarks about the insufficient speed of the robot-arm for an efficient collaborative process. Our results indicate a wider spectrum of questions to be further explored in the design of collaborative experiences with intelligent technological counterparts considering efficiency, safety, economic success and well-being.  © 2020 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85100051139"

One key focus of this stream is the enablement of trust between end users and the intelligent solution. Although, the current body of literature discusses and proposes a range of best practices for the design of user interfaces for intelligent solutions, there is a dearth of research how such interfaces are perceived by users and especially focusing on trust in these interfaces. In this paper, we investigate how the Big Five personality traits affect trust in AI-enabled user interfaces. We then experimentally verify which design best practices and guidelines proposed by Google enable trust in AI-enabled user interfaces for the different personality types. Initial results (n = 211) reveal that three of the Big Five personality traits – Extraversion, Agreeableness and Open-Mindedness – show a significant correlation between the degree of the personality trait and trust in the proposed storyboards. In addition, we identified significant positive relationships between the perception of trust by users and four out of the twelve design principles: review implicit feedback; connect the feedback to UX changes; create opportunities for feedback; fail gracefully and highlight failure. This paper is of a highly explorative character and provides first experimental results on designing for trust to the HCI/AI community and also highlights future research directions in the form of a research agenda. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85112209426"

The success achieved in this domain has not seen much improvement compared to the other face recognition problems. Any language in the world has a separate set of words and grammatical rules when addressing people of different ages. The decision associated with its usage, relies on our ability to demarcate these individual characteristics like gender and age from the facial appearances at one glance. With the rapid usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based systems in different fields, we expect that such decision making capability of these systems match as much as to the human capability. To this end, in this work, we have designed a deep learning based model, called GRA-Net (Gated Residual Attention Network), for the prediction of age and gender from the facial images. This is a modified and improved version of Residual Attention Network where we have included the concept of Gate in the architecture. Gender identification is a binary classification problem whereas prediction of age is a regression problem. We have decomposed this regression problem into a combination of classification and regression problems for achieving better accuracy. Experiments have been done on five publicly available standard datasets namely FG-Net, Wikipedia, AFAD, UTKFAce and AdienceDB. Obtained results have proven its effectiveness for both age and gender classification, thus making it a proper candidate for the same against any other state-of-the-art methods.  © 2013 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85107371767"

Due to recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) (deep learning, brain-inspired computational paradigms, nonlinear predictions, neuro-fuzzy modeling), the early prediction of neurodegenerative diseases is possible using state-of-the-art computational technologies. The latest generation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) exploits capabilities such as online learning, fast training, high level knowledge representation, online evolution, learning by data and inferring rules. Wearable electronics is also developing rapidly and represents an important enabling technology to deploy physical and practical (noninvasive) devices using AI-based models for early prediction of neurodegenerative diseases and of intelligent prostheses. Here we describe how to apply advanced brain-inspired methods for inference and prediction, the evolving fuzzy neural network (EFuNN) paradigm and the spiking neural network (SNN) paradigm, and the system requirements to develop a wearable electronic prosthesis for functional rehabilitation. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85090198982"

Moreover, to further elucidate the importance of the primary pharmacophore stereochemistry in the design of bitopic ligands, we investigated the chiral requirements of (+)-PD128907 ((+)-(4aR,10bR)-2)) by synthesizing and resolving bitopic analogues in all the cis and trans combinations of its 9-methoxy-3,4,4a,10b-tetrahydro-2H,5H-chromeno[4,3-b][1,4] oxazine scaffold. Despite the lack of success in obtaining new analogues with improved biological profiles, in comparison to our current leads, a ""negative""result due to a poor or simply not improved biological profile is fundamental toward better understanding chemical space and optimal stereochemistry for target recognition. Herein, we identified essential structural information to understand the differences between orthosteric and bitopic ligand-receptor binding interactions, discriminate D3R active and inactive states, and assist multitarget receptor recognition. Exploring stereochemical complexity and developing extended D3R SAR from this new library complements previously described SAR and inspires future structural and computational biology investigation.

This raises concerns when AI is applied to healthcare, where a patient trusting the advice of an unreliable system, or completely distrusting a reliable one, can lead to fatal incidents or missed healthcare opportunities. Previous research indicated that explanations can help users to make appropriate judgements on AI Systems' trust, but how to design AI explanation interfaces for non-expert users in a medical support scenarios is still an open research challenge. This paper explores a stage-based participatory design process to develop a trustworthy explanation interface for non-experts in an AI medical support scenario. A trustworthy explanation is an explanation that helps users to make considered judgments on trusting (or not) and AI system for their healthcare. The objective of this paper was to identify the explanation components that can effectively inform the design of a trustworthy explanation interface. To achieve that, we undertook three data collections, examining experts' and non-experts' perceptions of AI medical support system's explanations. We then developed a User Mental Model, an Expert Mental Model, and a Target Mental Model of explanation, describing how non-expert and experts understand explanations, how their understandings differ, and how it can be combined. Based on the Target Mental Model, we then propose a set of 14 explanation design guidelines for trustworthy AI Healthcare System explanation, that take into account non-expert users needs, medical experts practice, and AI experts understanding. © 2020  Copyright © 2021 for this paper by its authors.","2-s2.0-85110537156"

This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trial protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted upon by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items that were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations for the handling of input and output data, the human–AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret, and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial. © 2020 The Author(s).

Understanding the variety of issues of social pulsation is crucial in development of social sustainability. However, issues in social media generally change overtime. Issues not identified in advance may soon become popular topics discussed in society, particularly controversial issues. Previous studies have focused on the detection of hot topics and discussion of controversial issues, rather than the identification of potential controversial issues, which truly require paying attention to social sustainability. Furthermore, previous studies have focused on issue detection and tracking based on historical data. However, not all controversial issues are related to historical data to foster the cases. To avoid the above-mentioned research gap, Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an essential role in issue detection in the early stage. In this study, an AI-based solution approach is proposed to resolve two practical problems in social media: (1) the impact caused by the number of fan pages from Facebook and (2) awareness of the levels for an issue. The proposed solution approach to detect potential issues is based on the popularity of public opinion in social media using a Web crawler to collect daily posts related to issues in social media under a big data environment. Some analytical findings are carried out via the congregational rules proposed in this research, and the solution approach detects the attentive subjects in the early stages. A comparison of the proposed method to the traditional methods are illustrated in the domain of green energy. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed approach is accurate and effective and therefore it provides significant contribution to upsurge green energy deployment. © 2020 by the authors.

METHODS The computer-assisted reporting and decision support (CAR/DS) framework has been developed to enable systematic ingestion of guidelines as clinical decision structured reporting tools embedded within the radiologist’s workflow. RESULTS CAR/DS tools can reduce the radiology reporting variability and increase compliance with clinical guidelines. The lung cancer use-case is used to describe various scenarios of a cancer imaging structured reporting pathway, including incidental findings, screening, staging, and restaging or continued care. Various aspects of these tools are also described using cancer-related examples for different imaging modalities and applications such as calculators. Such systems can leverage artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to assist with the generation of structured reports and there are opportunities for new AI applications to be created using the structured data associated with CAR/DS tools.

Since HCAI systems are developed and implemented in multiple organizational structures, I propose 15 recommendations at three levels of governance: team, organization, and industry. The recommendations are intended to increase the reliability, safety, and trustworthiness of HCAI systems: (1) reliable systems based on sound software engineering practices, (2) safety culture through business management strategies, and (3) trustworthy certification by independent oversight. Software engineering practices within teams include audit trails to enable analysis of failures, software engineering workflows, verification and validation testing, bias testing to enhance fairness, and explainable user interfaces. The safety culture within organizations comes from management strategies that include leadership commitment to safety, hiring and training oriented to safety, extensive reporting of failures and near misses, internal review boards for problems and future plans, and alignment with industry standard practices. The trustworthiness certification comes from industry-wide efforts that include government interventions and regulation, accounting firms conducting external audits, insurance companies compensating for failures, nongovernmental and civil society organizations advancing design principles, and professional organizations and research institutes developing standards, policies, and novel ideas.

We argue that such an approach to solution development makes the outcome of solutions less explainable, i.e., it is often not possible to explain the results of the model. There is a growing concern among policymakers in cities with this lack of explainability of AI solutions, and this is considered a major hindrance in the wider acceptability and trust in such AI-based solutions. In this work, we survey the concept of ‘explainable deep learning’ as a subset of the ‘explainable AI’ problem and propose a new solution using Semantic Web technologies, demonstrated with a smart cities flood monitoring application in the context of a European Commission-funded project. Monitoring of gullies and drainage in crucial geographical areas susceptible to flooding issues is an important aspect of any flood monitoring solution. Typical solutions for this problem involve the use of cameras to capture images showing the affected areas in real-time with different objects such as leaves, plastic bottles etc., and building a DL-based classifier to detect such objects and classify blockages based on the presence and coverage of these objects in the images. In this work, we uniquely propose an Explainable AI solution using DL and Semantic Web technologies to build a hybrid classifier. In this hybrid classifier, the DL component detects object presence and coverage level and semantic rules designed with close consultation with experts carry out the classification. By using the expert knowledge in the flooding context, our hybrid classifier provides the flexibility on categorising the image using objects and their coverage relationships. The experimental results demonstrated with a real-world use case showed that this hybrid approach of image classification has on average 11% improvement (F-Measure) in image classification performance compared to DL-only classifier. It also has the distinct advantage of integrating experts’ knowledge on defining the decision-making rules to represent the complex circumstances and using such knowledge to explain the results. © 2020 by the authors.

Different Artificial Intelligence (AI) based applications are commonly utilized in embedded systems from which computer vision based approaches are included. The demand for higher accuracy in computer vision applications is associated with the increased complexity of convolutional neural networks and the storage requirement for saving pre-trained networks. Different factors can lead to the data corruption in the storage units of the embedded systems, which can result in drastic failures due to the propagation of the errors. Hence, the development of software-based algorithms for the detection and recovery of data corruption is crucial for improvement and failure-prevention of embedded systems. This paper proposes a new algorithm for the recovery of the data in the case of single event upset (SEU) error. The association rule mining based algorithm will be used to find the probability of the corruption in each of the bits.

Inspired by the dual-process theory in psychology, this paper proposes a human-in-the-loop approach to develop System-2 AI that makes an inference logically and outputs interpretable explanation. Our proposed method first asks crowd workers to raise understandable features of objects of multiple classes and collect training data from the Internet to generate classifiers for the features. Logical decision rules with the set of generated classifiers can explain why each object is of a particular class. In our preliminary experiment, we applied our method to an image classification of Asian national flags and examined the effectiveness and issues of our method.

Likewise, the focused deterrence approach identifies vulnerable individuals and offers certain treatments (e.g., outreach services) to prevent violence in communities. Our rule-based engine model is the first AI-based model for victim prediction purposes. The model merit is the usage of criminology studies to construct the rule-based engine to predict victims. This paper aims to compare the list of focused deterrence strategy with the VIPAR score list regarding their predictive power for the future shooting victimizations. Drawing on the criminological studies, this study uses age, past criminal history, and peer influence as the main predictors of future violence. Network graph analysis is employed to measure the influence of peers on the outcome variable. The proposed model also uses logistic regression analysis to verify the variable selections in the model. Following the analytical process, the current research creates an automated model (VIPAR scores) to predict vulnerable populations for their future shooting involvements. Our empirical results show that VIPAR scores predict 25.8% of future shooting victims and 32.2% of future shooting suspects, whereas the focused deterrence list predicts 13% of future shooting victims and 9.4% of future shooting suspects. The proposed model outperforms the intelligence list of focused deterrence policies in predicting the future fatal and non-fatal shootings. Furthermore, this paper discusses the concerns about the presumption of innocence right. © 2020","2-s2.0-85092164108"

Early identification and effective treatment of BE-related neoplasia prior to the development of invasive adenocarcinoma are essential to limiting the morbidity and mortality associated with this cancer. In this review, we summarized the recent evidence guiding endoscopic eradication therapies (EET) for neoplastic BE. Recent Findings: New sampling technologies and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) systems have potential to revolutionize early neoplasia detection in BE. EET for BE are safe and effective in achieving complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CE-IM) and reducing the progression to EAC, a practice endorsed by all GI society guidelines. EET should be considered in patients with high-grade dysplasia (HGD), intramucosal carcinoma (IMC), and select cases with low-grade dysplasia (LGD). The increasing use of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in the West may allow EET of select cases with submucosal EAC. Post-EET surveillance strategies will continue to evolve as knowledge of specific risk factors and long-term neoplasia recurrence rates improve. Summary: In the last decade, major advancements in EET for neoplastic BE have been achieved. These now represent the standard of care in the management of BE-related dysplasia and intramucosal cancer. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85097172683"

This study deals with designing a Local Analytical System for early Epidemic detection in which the data related to human regular needs and responses are stored in the in-cube format. Analytical rules are used to produced faster pre-computed and pre-summarized inputs of the warehouse. Some desired inputs are selected from many local Warehouses which are then consolidated to form an incremental next higher-level data using the Layered Architecture style. This system can find the most commonly deviated data from the most frequently occurred patterns in the data submitted from the participating warehouses.

While AI systems and concerns for their ethical operation are not new, the scale of impact and adoption of AI systems in legal practice makes consideration of the ethics of these systems timely. While there has been recent progress in development of ethical guidelines for AI systems, much of this is targeted at the developers of these systems in general, or the actions of these AI systems as autonomous entities, rather than in the legal practice context. Much of the ethical guidance - whether for AI systems or legal professional is captured in high level principles within more narrowly defined domains, more specific guidance may be appropriate to identify and assess ethical risks.

It takes additional multiple years of the clinical practice to handle various “non-typical” cases. The purpose of our study was to predict neurodegenerative disease development by abstract rules learned from experienced neurologists. Theory of mind (ToM) is human’s ability to represent mental states such as emotions, intensions or knowledge of others. ToM is crucial not only in human social interactions but also is used by neurologists to find an optimal treatment for patients with neurodegenerative pathologies such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). On the basis of doctors’ expertise, we have used supervised learning to build AI system that consists of abstract granules representing ToM of several movement disorders neurologists (their knowledge and intuitions). We were looking for similarities between granules of patients in different disease stages to granules of more advanced PD patients. We have compared group of 23 PD with attributes measured three times every half of the year (G1V1, G1V2, G1V3) to other group of 24 more advanced PD (G2V1). By means of the supervised learning and rough set theory we have found rules describing symptoms of G2V1 and applied them to G1V1, G1V2, and G1V3. We have obtained the following accuracies for all/speed/emotion/cognition attributes: G1V1: 68/59/53/72%; G1V2: 72/70/79/79%; G1V3: 82/92/71/74%. These results support our hypothesis that divergent sets of granules were characteristic for different brain’s parts that might degenerate in non-uniform ways with Parkinson’s disease progression. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85111356375"

The main objective was to propose safety guidelines for implementing AI black‐box models to reduce the risk of potential healthcare‐related incidents and accidents. The system was developed by adopting the multi‐attribute value model approach (MAVT), which comprises four symmetrical parts: extracting attributes, generating weights for the attributes, developing a rating scale, and finalizing the system. On the basis of the MAVT approach, three layers of attributes were created. The first level contained six key dimensions, the second level included 14 attributes, and the third level comprised 78 attributes. The key first level dimensions of the SCS included safety policies, incentives for clinicians, clinician and patient training, communication and interaction, planning of actions, and control of such actions. The proposed system may provide a basis for detecting AI utilization risks, preventing incidents from occurring, and developing emergency plans for AI‐related risks.

Demands for ethical AI are declared from all directions. As a response, in recent years, public bodies, governments, and universities have rushed in to provide a set of principles to be considered when AI based systems are designed and used. We have learned, however, that high-level principles do not turn easily into actionable advice for practitioners. Hence, also companies are publishing their own ethical guidelines to guide their AI development. This paper argues that AI software is still software and needs to be approached from the software development perspective. The software engineering paradigm has introduced maturity model thinking, which provides a roadmap for companies to improve their performance from the selected viewpoints known as the key capabilities. We want to voice out a call for action for the development of a maturity model for AI software. We wish to discuss whether the focus should be on AI ethics or, more broadly, the quality of an AI system, called a maturity model for the development of AI systems.

Its widespread use has been instrumental in ensuring transparency when evaluating new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes. The CONSORT-AI extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI. Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process, involving a literature review and expert consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed on in a two-day consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The CONSORT-AI extension includes 14 new items, which were considered sufficiently important for AI interventions, that they should be routinely reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the human-AI interaction and providing analysis of error cases. CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions. It will assist editors and peer-reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the quality of clinical trial design and risk of bias in the reported outcomes.  © ","2-s2.0-85090820711"

Engineers perform much of the work. While they gear the results towards healthcare professionals, the difference in competencies and goals creates challenges for collaboration and knowledge exchange. We aim to provide clinicians with a context and understanding of AI research by facilitating communication between creators, researchers, clinicians, and readers of medical AI and ML research. Methods and results — We present the common tasks, considerations, and pitfalls (both methodological and ethical) that clinicians will encounter in AI research. We discuss the following topics: labeling, missing data, training, testing, and overfitting. Common performance and outcome measures for various AI and ML tasks are presented, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Dice score, the area under the curve, and ROC curves. We also discuss ethical considerations in terms of privacy, fairness, autonomy, safety, responsibility, and liability regarding data collecting or sharing. Interpretation — We have developed guidelines for reporting medical AI research to clinicians in the run-up to a broader consensus process. The proposed guidelines consist of a Clinical Artificial Intelligence Research (CAIR) checklist and specific performance metrics guidelines to present and evaluate research using AI components. Researchers, engineers, clinicians, and other stakeholders can use these proposal guidelines and the CAIR checklist to read, present, and evaluate AI research geared towards a healthcare setting. © 2021 The Author(s).

With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the ability of AI systems to make automated and self-learned decisions, a call for transparency of how such systems reach decisions has echoed within academic and policy circles. The term transparency, however, relates to multiple concepts, fulfills many functions, and holds different promises that struggle to be realized in concrete applications. Indeed, the complexity of transparency for ADM shows tension between transparency as a normative ideal and its translation to practical application. To address this tension, we first conduct a review of transparency, analyzing its challenges and limitations concerning automated decision-making practices. We then look at the lessons learned from the development of Privacy by Design, as a basis for developing the Transparency by Design principles. Finally, we propose a set of nine principles to cover relevant contextual, technical, informational, and stakeholder-sensitive considerations. Transparency by Design is a model that helps organizations design transparent AI systems, by integrating these principles in a step-by-step manner and as an ex-ante value, not as an afterthought. © 2020, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85096069984"

Recently, denial of service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are reported as the most frequent attacks in IoT networks. The traditional security solutions like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, etc., are unable to detect the complex DoS and DDoS attacks since most of them filter the normal and attack traffic based upon the static predefined rules. However, these solutions can become reliable and effective when integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques. During the last few years, deep learning models especially convolutional neural networks achieved high significance due to their outstanding performance in the image processing field. The potential of these convolutional neural network (CNN) models can be used to efficiently detect the complex DoS and DDoS by converting the network traffic dataset into images. Therefore, in this work, we proposed a methodology to convert the network traffic data into image form and trained a state-of-the-art CNN model, i.e., ResNet over the converted data. The proposed methodology accomplished 99.99% accuracy for detecting the DoS and DDoS in case of binary classification. Furthermore, the proposed methodology achieved 87% average precision for recognizing eleven types of DoS and DDoS attack patterns which is 9% higher as compared to the state-of-the-art. © 2020 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85100614855"

Unfortunately, this is a complex task, since writing rules that distinguish harmful from non-harmful actions tends to be quite difficult in real-world situations. Therefore, such decisions have historically been made by a small group of powerful AI companies and developers, with limited community input. In this paper, we study how to enable a crowd of non-AI experts to work together to communicate high-quality, reliable constraints to AI systems. We first focus on understanding how humans reason about temporal dynamics in the context of AI behavior, finding through experiments on a novel game-based testbed that participants tend to adopt a long-term notion of harm, even in uncertain situations that do not affect them directly. Building off of this insight, we explore task design for long-term constraint specification, developing new filtering approaches and new methods of promoting user reflection. Next, we develop a novel rule-based interface which allows people to craft rules in an accessible fashion without programming knowledge. We test our approaches on a real-world AI problem in the domain of education, and find that our new filtering mechanisms and interfaces significantly improve constraint quality and human efficiency. We also demonstrate how these systems can be applied to other real-world AI problems (e.g. in social networks).  © 2020 ACM.","2-s2.0-85094203495"

Health care organizations have responded to the first phase of the pandemic by rapidly adopting digital solutions and advanced technology tools. Objective: The aim of this review is to describe the digital solutions that have been reported in the early scientific literature to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on individuals and health systems. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of early COVID-19–related literature (from January 1 to April 30, 2020) by searching MEDLINE and medRxiv with appropriate terms to find relevant literature on the use of digital technologies in response to the pandemic. We extracted study characteristics such as the paper title, journal, and publication date, and we categorized the retrieved papers by the type of technology and patient needs addressed. We built a scoring rubric by cross-classifying the patient needs with the type of technology. We also extracted information and classified each technology reported by the selected articles according to health care system target, grade of innovation, and scalability to other geographical areas. Results: The search identified 269 articles, of which 124 full-text articles were assessed and included in the review after screening. Most of the selected articles addressed the use of digital technologies for diagnosis, surveillance, and prevention. We report that most of these digital solutions and innovative technologies have been proposed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In particular, within the reviewed articles, we identified numerous suggestions on the use of artificial intelligence (AI)–powered tools for the diagnosis and screening of COVID-19. Digital technologies are also useful for prevention and surveillance measures, such as contact-tracing apps and monitoring of internet searches and social media usage. Fewer scientific contributions address the use of digital technologies for lifestyle empowerment or patient engagement. Conclusions: In the field of diagnosis, digital solutions that integrate with traditional methods, such as AI-based diagnostic algorithms based both on imaging and clinical data, appear to be promising. For surveillance, digital apps have already proven their effectiveness; however, problems related to privacy and usability remain. For other patient needs, several solutions have been proposed, such as telemedicine or telehealth tools. These tools have long been available, but this historical moment may actually be favoring their definitive large-scale adoption. It is worth taking advantage of the impetus provided by the crisis; it is also important to keep track of the digital solutions currently being proposed to implement best practices and models of care in future and to adopt at least some of the solutions proposed in the scientific literature, especially in national health systems, which have proved to be particularly resistant to the digital transition in recent years.

However, a large number of Artificial Intelligence applications are produced by developers without proper training on software quality practices or processes, and in general, lack in-depth knowledge regarding software engineering processes. The main reason is due to the fact that the machine-learning engineer profession has been born very recently, and currently there is a very limited number of training or guidelines on issues (such as code quality or testing) for machine learning and applications using machine learning code. In this work, we aim at highlighting the main software quality issues of Artificial Intelligence systems, with a central focus on machine learning code, based on the experience of our four research groups. Moreover, we aim at defining a shared research road map, that we would like to discuss and to follow in collaboration with the workshop participants.

Likewise, scrutinizing expert domain knowledge is pivotal to guarantee data quality and enhance algorithmic accuracy, by zooming in on the types of data and information that constitute relevant and reliable representations in a given domain. Against this backdrop, the paper revitalizes the field of knowledge acquisition and presents easily applicable user-centered and value-oriented dialogical guidelines to unravel domain knowledge with the aim of enhancing the design of explainable interfaces and algorithmic accuracy. While it might seem counter-intuitive to revisit the field of knowledge acquisition in the era of machine learning and deep learning, there are plenty of cases in which AI systems, trained on biased data, have led to epistemological deficiencies with morally harmful consequences. In order to improve the data preparation and modelling stage in the development of ML models, this paper suggests that AI developers could benefit from the pragmatic application of manageable dialogical guidelines aided by knowledge acquisition to cultivate shared understanding between AI developers and domain expert end users. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85096464793"

The idea here is that highly customized products can move dynamically and autonomously through a system of flexible workstations without fixed production cycles. This approach has challenging demands regarding planning and organization of such systems. Since each product can define its way through the system freely and individually, implementing rules and heuristics that leverage the flexibility in the system in order to increase performance can be difficult in this dynamic environment. Transport tasks are usually carried out by automated guided vehicles (AGVs). Therefore, integration of AI-based control logics offer a promising alternative to manually implemented decision rules for operating the AGVs. This paper presents an approach for using reinforcement learning (RL) in combination with simulation in order to control AGVs in modular production systems.

The difficulty stems from the unique nature of ML, namely, system behavior is derived from training data not from logical design by human engineers. This leads to black-box and intrinsically imperfect implementations that invalidate many principles and techniques in traditional software engineering. In light of this situation, the Japanese industry has jointly worked on a set of guidelines for the quality assurance of AI systems (in the Consortium of Quality Assurance for AI-based Products and Services) from the viewpoint of traditional quality-assurance engineers and test engineers. We report on the second version of these guidelines, which cover a list of quality evaluation aspects, catalogue of current state-of-the-art techniques, and domain-specific discussions in five representative domains.

We find that there is no significant difference in task completion or several aspects of user preference between the two systems, but that users would be significantly happier to talk to the task-only system in the future.

We developed a propositional artificial intelligence (AI) system based on the above concepts to support physicians in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Methods: We analyzed and built ontology knowledge for the classification of seizure patterns, epilepsy, epilepsy syndrome, and etiologies. Protégé ontology tool was applied in this study. In order to enable the system to be close to the inferential thinking of clinical experts, we classified and constructed knowledge of other epilepsy-related knowledge, including comorbidities, epilepsy imitators, epilepsy descriptors, characteristic electroencephalography (EEG) findings, treatments, etc. We used the Ontology Web Language with Description Logic (OWL-DL) and Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to design rules for expressing the relationship between these ontologies. Results: Dravet syndrome was taken as an illustration for epilepsy syndromes implementation. We designed an interface for the physician to enter the various characteristics of the patients. Clinical data of an 18-year-old boy with epilepsy was applied to the AI system. Through SWRL and reasoning engine Drool's execution, we successfully demonstrate the process of differential diagnosis. Conclusion: We developed a propositional AI system by using the OWL-DL/SWRL approach to deal with the complexity of current epilepsy diagnosis.

In particular, those used in cold storages can be subject to frosting in the scanner window when they are carried out of the warehouses to a room-temperature space outside. To prevent this, they usually employ a film heater on the scanner window. However, the temperature and humidity conditions of the surrounding environment and the temperature of the terminal itself that cause frosting vary widely. Due to the complicated frost-forming conditions, existing industrial mobile terminals choose to implement rather simple rules that operate the film heater well above the freezing point, which inevitably leads to inefficient energy use. This paper demonstrates that to avoid such waste, on-device artificial intelligence (AI) a.k.a. edge AI can be readily employed to industrial mobile terminals and can improve their energy efficiency. We propose an artificial-intelligence-based approach that utilizes deep learning technology to avoid the energy-wasting defrosting operations. By combining the traditional temperature-sensing logic with a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier that visually checks for frost, we can more precisely control the defrosting operation. We embed the CNN classifier in the device and demonstrate that the approach significantly reduces the energy consumption. On our test terminal, the net ratio of the energy consumption by the existing system to that of the edge AI for the heating film is almost 14:1. Even with the common current-dissipation accounted for, our edge AI system would increase the operating hours by 86%, or by more than 6 h compared with the system without the edge AI. © 2020 by the authors.

The main goal of the E2R Methodology is to present clear and easily understood documents. This methodology includes a set of guidelines and recommendations that affect the writing of texts, the supporting images, the design and layout of documents, and the final editing format. Such guidelines are used in the manual processes of (a) adapting existing documents and (b) producing new materials. The process of adapting existing documents is cyclic and implies three activities: analysis, transformation, and validation. All these activities are human resource consuming, due to the need of involving people with cognitive disabilities as well as E2R experts. In order to alleviate such processes, we are currently investigating the development of methods, based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, to perform the analysis and transformation of documents in a (semi)-automatic fashion. In this paper we present our AI-based method for assessing a particular document with respect to the E2R guidelines as well as an initial implementation of such a method; our research on the transformation of documents is out of the scope of this paper.

To support them, we focus on the creation of an AI system that is able to emulate clinical reasoning. We leverage Semantic Web technologies to perform a set of AI tasks involving the various forms of inference associated with clinical reasoning strategies. In particular, for the scope of this work, we focus on clinical problems that require differential diagnosis techniques. For a given clinical scenario, overlapping reasoning types and strategies may be employed by a physician in conjunction, signifying the need for our AI system to perform hybrid reasoning. Therefore, we consider the construction of a hybrid reasoner that is compatible with description logics. For medical scenarios where description logics may not have some needed expressivity, we consider possible extensions that will allow for the representation of such a scenario. The reasoning system, clinical rule representation, and the resulting recommendations will be evaluated based on domain expert consultation in order to determine whether the recommendation aligns with what the expert would recommend.

However, medical assessments can be contentious, leading to expert disagreement. This raises the question of how AI assistants should be designed to handle the classification of ambiguous cases. Our study compared two AI assistants that provide classification labels for medical time series data along with quantitative uncertainty estimates: conventional vs. ambiguity-aware. We simulated our ambiguity-aware AI based on real-world expert discussions to highlight cases likely to lead to expert disagreement, and to present arguments for conflicting classification choices. Our results demonstrate that ambiguity-aware AI can alter expert workflows by significantly increasing the proportion of contentious cases reviewed. We also found that the relevance of AI-provided arguments (selected from guidelines either randomly or by experts) affected experts' accuracy at revising AI-suggested labels.

These include targeted cash transfers (CTs), as well as targeted subsidies in health, education, housing, energy, childcare, and others. Due to the scale, diversity, and widespread relevance of targeted social policies like CTs, the algorithmic rules that decide who is eligible to benefit from them-and who is not-are among the most important algorithms operating in the world today. Here we report on a year-long engagement towards improving social targeting systems in a couple of developing countries. We demonstrate that a shift towards the use of AI methods in poverty-based targeting can substantially increase accuracy, extending the coverage of the poor by nearly a million people in two countries, without increasing expenditure. However, we also show that, absent explicit parity constraints, both status quo and AI-based systems induce disparities across population subgroups. Moreover, based on qualitative interviews with local social institutions, we find a lack of consensus on normative standards for prioritization and fairness criteria. Hence, we close by proposing a decision-support platform for distributed governance, which enables a diversity of institutions to customize the use of AI-based insights into their targeting decisions. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Medical Experts (ME) in particular while using an AI assistant system must understand how the system generates disease diagnoses before making patient care decisions based on the AI’s output. In this paper, we report our work in progress and preliminary findings toward the development of a human-centered explainable AI (XAI) specifically for the diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). We applied syllogistic inference rules based on CAD Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) to interpret the data mining results using a Support Vector Machine (i.e., SVM) classification technique—which forms an early model for a knowledge base (KB). The SVM’s inference rules are then explained through a voice system to the MEs. Based on our initial findings, we discovered that MEs trusted the system’s diagnoses when the XAI described the chain of reasoning behind the diagnosis process in a more interpretable form—suggesting an enhanced level of trust. Using syllogistic rules alone, however, to interpret the classification of the SVM algorithm lacked sufficient contextual information—which required augmentation with more descriptive explanations provided by a medical expert. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","2-s2.0-85090173196"

In such context, the existing RPA platforms that include AI-based solutions classify their components, i.e. constituting part of a robot that performs a set of actions, in a way that seems to obey market or business decisions instead of common-sense rules. To be more precise, components that present similar functionality are identified with different names and grouped in different ways depending on the platform that provides the components. Therefore, the analysis of different cognitive RPA platforms to check their suitability for facing a specific need is typically a time-consuming and error-prone task. To overcome this problem and to provide users with support in the development of an RPA project, this paper proposes a method for the systematic construction of a taxonomy of cognitive RPA components.

How can we promote morally sound behaviour in such settings, in order to obtain more desirable outcomes? A solution from moral philosophy is the concept of a social contract, a set of rules that people would voluntarily commit to in order to obtain better outcomes than those brought by anarchy. We adapt this concept to a game-theoretic setting, to systematically modify the payoffs of a non-cooperative game, so that agents will rationally pursue socially desirable outcomes. We show that for any game, a suitable social contract can be designed to produce an optimal outcome in terms of social welfare.

Artificial intelligence (AI) provides a promising solution. Plastic surgery is an innovative surgical specialty expected to implement AI into current and future practices. It is important for all plastic surgeons to understand how AI may affect current and future practice, and to recognise its potential limitations. METHODS Peer-reviewed published literature and online content were comprehensively reviewed. We report current applications of AI in plastic surgery and possible future applications based on published literature and continuing scientific studies, and detail its potential limitations and ethical considerations. FINDINGS Current machine learning models using convolutional neural networks can evaluate breast mammography and differentiate benign and malignant tumours as accurately as specialist doctors, and motion sensor surgical instruments can collate real-time data to advise intraoperative technical adjustments. Centralised big data portals are expected to collate large datasets to accelerate understanding of disease pathogeneses and best practices. Information obtained using computer vision could guide intraoperative surgical decisions in unprecedented detail and semi-autonomous surgical systems guided by AI algorithms may enable improved surgical outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. Surgeons must collaborate with computer scientists to ensure that AI algorithms inform clinically relevant health objectives and are interpretable. Ethical concerns such as systematic biases causing non-representative conclusions for under-represented patient groups, patient confidentiality and the limitations of AI based on the quality of data input suggests that AI will accompany the plastic surgeon, rather than replace them. © 2020 Royal College of Surgeons of England.

The law assumes a rational approach to rule application in deciding a defendant’s guilt; however, judges and juries can behave irrationally. What should a model prize: efficiency, accuracy, or fairness? Exactly whether and how to incorporate the psychology of courtroom interactions into formal models or expert systems has only just begun to be examined in a serious fashion. Here, I outline data from the United States which suggest that trying to incorporate psychological biases into formal models of legal decision-making will be challenging. I focus on the use of neuroscience data in criminal trials, homing in on so-called group-to-individual (G2i) inferences. I argue that data which should be the most effective at swaying judicial decisions are in fact those most likely not to make a difference in the disposition of the case.

As a solution, 'Trustworthy AI' research area merged with the goal of defining guidelines and frameworks for improving user trust in AI systems, allowing humans to use them without fear. While trust in AI is an active area of research, very little work exists where the focus is to build human trust to improve the interactions between human and AI systems.

The paper analyzed the common failures of the steam turbine regenerative system and established a typical fault set of the regenerative system. On the basis of using the fuzzy rules to establish knowledge base of fault symptom of regenerative system, a fault diagnosis method of regenerative system based on support vector machine multi-classification algorithm was proposed.

Representing, learning, and reasoning with preferences is an important area of study both within computer science and across the social sciences. When we give our preferences to an AI system we expect the system to make decisions or recommendations that are consistent with our preferences but the decisions should also adhere to certain norms, guidelines, and ethical principles. Hence, when working with preferences it is necessary to understand and compute a metric (distance) between preferences – especially if we encode both the user preferences and ethical systems in the same formalism.

We leverage a recently proposed metric for CP-nets and propose a neural network architecture to learn an approximation of the metric, CPMetric.

These projects often deal with ETL processes, in which humans extract information from non-machine-readable documents by hand. AI-based machine learning models can help to solve this problem. Since machine learning approaches are not deterministic, their quality of output may decrease over time. This fact leads to an overall quality loss of the application which embeds machine learning models. Hence, the software qualities in development and production may differ. Machine learning models are black boxes. That makes practitioners skeptical and increases the inhibition threshold for early productive use of research prototypes. Continuous monitoring of software quality in production offers an early response capability on quality loss and encourages the use of machine learning approaches. Furthermore, experts have to ensure that they integrate possible new inputs into the model training as quickly as possible. In this paper, we introduce an architecture pattern with a reference implementation that extends the concept of Metrics Driven Research Collaboration with an automated software quality monitoring in productive use and a possibility to auto-generate new test data coming from processed documents in production. Through automated monitoring of the software quality and auto-generated test data, this approach ensures that the software quality meets and keeps requested thresholds in productive use, even during further continuous deployment and changing input data.  © 2020 ACM.","2-s2.0-85093118440"

Smart grids are known as the new generation of power systems applying intelligent tools and features to provide higher performance, stability, reliability, and manageability. For these purposes, power systems face two major challenges. The first one is the systems are more vulnerable to a cyberattack. This vulnerability originates from relying on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems. The second challenge is the consumption of fossil fuels as a major power source increases, which is costly and pollutes the environment, so it is necessary to use renewable energy like the wind as an alternative. Regarding enormous fluctuations in wind speed at different months and even each minute of a day, whereas it is impossible to store electrical energy on a massive scale, prediction plays a major rule to integrate the power grid and wind energy. Therefore, to address these challenges, some of the Machine Learning algorithms are tested to detect attacks and predict wind power generation. This chapter first detects attacks on a dataset that comes from a smart grid, the results are compared based on F-Score (Precision/Recall) Accuracy and also considering the velocity.

The state of the art in managing chronic conditions requires not only responding to the clinical needs of the patient, but also guaranteeing a comfortable state of wellbeing for them, despite living with the disease. This demands mutual effort between the patient and the physician in constantly collecting data, monitoring, and understanding the disease. The advent of artificial intelligence has made this process easier. However, studies have rarely attempted to analyze how the different artificial intelligence based health coaching systems are used to manage different types of chronic conditions. Objective: Throughout this grounded theory literature review, we aim to provide an overview for the features that characterize artificial intelligence based health coaching systems used by patients with chronic diseases. Methods: During our search and paper selection process process, we use three bibliographic libraries (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library). Using the grounded theory, we extract overarching themes for the artificial intelligence based health coaching systems. These systems are then classified according to their role, platform, type of interaction with the patient, as well as targeted chronic conditions. Of 869 citations retrieved, 31 unique studies are included in this review. Results: The included studies assess 14 different chronic conditions. Common roles for AI-based health coaching systems are: developing adherence, informing, motivating, reminding, preventing, building a care network, and entertaining. Health coaching systems combine the aforementioned roles to cater to the needs of the patients. The combinations of these roles differ between multilateral, unilateral, opposing bilateral, complementing bilateral, one-role-missing, and the blurred role combinations. Conclusion: Clinical solutions and research related to artificial intelligence based health coaching systems are very limited. Clear guidelines to help develop artificial intelligence-based health coaching systems are still blurred. This grounded theory literature review attempted to shed the light on the research and development requirements for an effective health coaching system intended for patients with chronic conditions. Researchers are recommended to use this review to identify the most suitable role combination for an effective health coaching system development. © 2020 by the authors.

Since intelligent systems are fact processors, one can ask how ethical machines can be possible. However, ethics is a real-life process. People analyze actions and situations emotionally and cognitively. Thus they learn rules, such as “this situation feels good/bad.” The cognitive analysis of actions is associated with emotional analysis. The association of action, emotion and cognition can be termed a primary ethical schema. Through an ethical information process in which emotions and cognitions interact in social discourse, primary ethical schemas are refined into ethical norms. Each component of the process is different, but they cooperate to construct an ethical approach to thinking. Hume’s guillotine mistakenly breaks down primary ethical schemas and juxtaposes emotions and cognitions. There is no ethics without coordinated emotional, cognitive and social analysis. Therefore, his theory can be seen as a pseudo problem. In the future, ethical processes will involve intelligent systems that can make ethical choices. Weak ethical artificial intelligence (AI) systems can apply given ethical rules to data, while strong ethical AI systems can derive their own rules from data and knowledge about human emotions. Resolving Hume’s guillotine introduces new ways to develop stronger forms of ethical AI. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85089165744"

One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and development. Objective: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify differences in the responses of different professional groups. Methods: This survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups. Results: In total, 86 of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote monitoring. Conclusions: This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

The goal of this study was to analyze what kind of ethical guidelines companies have for solving potential ethical issues of AI and developing AI systems. This paper presents the results of the case study conducted in three companies. The ethical guidelines defined by the case companies focused on solving potential ethical issues, such as accountability, explainability, fairness, privacy, and transparency. To analyze different viewpoints on critical ethical issues, two of the companies recommended using multi-disciplinary development teams. The companies also considered defining the purposes of their AI systems and analyzing their impacts to be important practices.

AI-based cybercrime becomes a product of technological development, posing a threat to national security, public security, and the protection of citizens' personal property rights and privacy rights. In particular, the derivation of cybercrime that follows the development of science and technology leads to a qualitative change in the patterns of cybercrimes, expanding the scope and depth of the harm caused by cybercrime, producing a series of impacts on the conviction rules of traditional criminal law in China. The defects such as the features of the principal offender being weakened, the definition of the responsibility for accessory to the principal offender not clear, the narrow scope applicable to one-sided accomplice are present. To this end, in the era where AI and cybercrime have deep integration, given the derivative trend of AI-based cybercrime, it is urgent to adjust the focus of criminal strategy against cybercrime. The horizontal docking of domestic substantive law and legal interpretation is performed to achieve a gradient balance between judicial interpretation and legislative amendment and adjust the criminal boundary in cybercrime evaluation, thereby changing the current high threshold of conviction in the cybercrime governance and late launch of punishment power.  © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","2-s2.0-85087385895"

Content analysis was conducted on AI R&D guidelines issued by more economically developed countries because they may guide the trend of AI-based applications in education. Specifically, this study consisted of three phases: 1) information retrieval, (2) key term extraction, and (3) data visualization. First, Fisher’s exact test was employed to ensure that different AI R&D guidelines (e.g., the latest ones in the US, EU, Japan, Mainland, and Taiwan) were comparable. Second, the Key Word Extraction System was developed to retrieve essential information in the guidelines. Third, data visualization techniques were performed on key terms across multiple guidelines. A word cloud revealed the similarity among guidelines (e.g., key terms that these guidelines share in common) while a color-coding scheme showed the differences (e.g., occurrence of a key term across guidelines and its frequency within a guideline). Importantly, three key terms, namely, AI, human, and development, are identified as essential commonality across guidelines.

RL-based risk mitigation modules are developed using three different Qnetworks to estimate the Q-value function. Our purpose is twofold: to perform a comparative analysis of FLS and RL in terms of safety perspectives and further to evaluate the efficiency to accomplish the task. Our results present that all the proposed risk mitigation strategies improve the safety aspect by up to 26% as compared to a default setup where the robot is just relying on a navigation module without risk mitigation. efficiency of using FLS model is maintained to the default setup, while the efficiency of using RL model is reduced by 26% from the default setup. We also compare the computation performance of risk mitigation between centralized and edge execution where the edge execution is 27.5 times faster than the centralized one. © 2020 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85087058230"

This paper investigates if and how the virtual enactment of two renowned moral dilemmas - -The Trolley and the Mad Bomber - -influence decision-making when compared with mentally visualizing such situations. We conducted two user studies with two gender-balanced samples of 60 participants in total that compared between paper-based and virtual-reality (VR) conditions, while simulating 5 distinct scenarios for the Trolley dilemma, and 4 storyline scenarios for the Mad Bomber's dilemma. Our findings suggest that the VR enactment of moral dilemmas further fosters utilitarian decision-making, while it amplifies biases such as sparing juveniles and seeking retribution. Ultimately, we theorize that the VR enactment of renowned moral dilemmas can yield ecologically-valid data for training future Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems on ethical decision-making, and we elicit early design principles for the training of such systems. © 2020 ACM.","2-s2.0-85091313894"

Nevertheless, ML's improved accuracy of prediction comes at the cost of low traceability due to its black-box nature. The field of explainable AI tries to counter this. However, for practical use in IT projects, these two research streams offer only partial advice for AI adoption as the trade-off between accuracy and explainability has not been adequately discussed yet. Thus, we simulate a decision process by implementing three best practice AI-based decision support systems for a high-stake maintenance decision scenario and evaluate the decision and attitude factors using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) through an expert survey. The combined results indicate that system performance is still the most important factor and that implementation effort and explainability are relatively even factors. Further, we found that systems using similarity-based matching or direct modeling for remaining useful life estimation performed best. © ICIS 2020. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-85099537611"

Its widespread use has been instrumental in ensuring transparency in the evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes. The CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials–Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials–Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a two-day consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The CONSORT-AI extension includes 14 new items that were considered sufficiently important for AI interventions that they should be routinely reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the human–AI interaction and provision of an analysis of error cases. CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions. It will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the quality of clinical trial design and risk of bias in the reported outcomes. © 2020, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85090819278"

At the same time products and services are evolving permanently. In order to cope with those circumstances, manufacturers should apply the principles of smart manufacturing together with continuous processes improvement. Smart manufacturing is a concept where production is no longer highly labor-intensive and based only on flexible manufacturing systems, but production as a whole process should be monitored and controlled with sophisticated information technology, integrated on all stages of the product life cycle. Process improvements in Smart Manufacturing are heavily reliance on decisions, which can be achieved by using modeling and simulation of systems with different analyzing tools based on Big Data processing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. This study was performed to automate an estimation process and improve the accuracy for production celĺs performance evaluation. Although there have been researches performed in the same field, the substantial estimation process outcome and accuracy still need to be elaborated further. In this article a robot integrated production cell simulation framework is developed. A developed system is used to simulate production cell parametric models in the real-life situations. A set of rules and constraints are created and inserted into the simulation model. Data for the constraints were acquired by investigating industries' best production cells performance parameters. Information was gathered in four main fields: company profile and strategy, cell layout and equipment, manufactured products process data and shortcomings of goal achievements or improvement necessary to perform. From those parametric case model, a 3D virtual manufacturing simulation model is built and simulated for achieving accurate results. The integration of manufacturing data into decision making process through advanced prescriptive analytics models is a one of the future tasks of this study. The integration makes it possible to use ""best practice""data and obtained Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) results to find the optimal solutions in real manufacturing conditions. The objective is to find the best solution of robot integrated cell for a certain industry using AI enabled simulation model. It also helps to improve situation assessment and deliberated decision-making mechanism..  Copyright © 2020 ASME.","2-s2.0-85101234317"

The need to adapt to new lifestyles, medication, and treatment routines, can produce an individual burden to the patient, who is often at home without the full support of healthcare professionals. Although technological solutions –in the form of mobile apps and wearables– have been proposed to mitigate these issues, it is essential to consider individual characteristics, preferences, and the context of a patient in order to offer personalized and effective support. The specific events and circumstances linked to an individual profile can be abstracted as a patient trajectory, which can contribute to a better understanding of the patient, her needs, and the most appropriate personalized support. Although patient trajectories have been studied for different illnesses and conditions, it remains challenging to effectively use them as the basis for data analytics methodologies in decentralized eHealth systems. In this work, we present a novel approach based on the multi-agent paradigm, considering patient trajectories as the cornerstone of a methodology for modelling eHealth support systems. In this design, semantic representations of individual treatment pathways are used in order to exchange patient-relevant information, potentially fed to AI systems for prediction and classification tasks.

A technology that does not meet the ethical criteria of a society is likely to face a long and hard process of acceptance regardless of its potentially tremendous positive potential for long-term socio-economic development. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is undoubtedly associated with the need to answer ethical questions, and the perception of AI in society will be largely determined by compliance with ethical criteria, whether written or not. At the same time, AI as a technological system itself does not have a natural ethical content; the authors believe that in practice ethical concerns may be addressed by means of ethical codes and compliance rules that articulate what constitutes ethical behaviour in specific areas of application of AI systems. Such a set of rules (a code for AI ethics) could be followed by all actors throughout the complete lifecycle of the system starting with the design stage. The specification of general ethical principles as industry-specific codes of practice would also facilitate classification, evaluation and measurement of systems, both at the technical level and at the level of public perception and trust.The article considers examples of codification of ethical principles and offers several approaches for practical use in solving issues of ethics in the field of AI at the national and international level.  © 2020 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85091986094"

Many different digital library users, each a member of a Society, engage in a diversity of Scenarios, often involving some aspect of exploration, usually of the DL content Streams. Services - e.g., searching, browsing, recommending, and visualizing - help those users leverage knowledge Structures and Spatial representations. Following on the final sentence of Licklider's book, we call for a formal base plus an overlay of experience, leading to a new way to build better DLs. Licklider said we seek the facts, concepts, principles, and ideas that lie behind the visible and tangible aspects of documents, to help us acquire and use knowledge. Put simply: The console of the procognitive system will have two special buttons, a silver one labeled 'Where am I and a gold one labeled 'What should I do next' How can we build and use this For more than 55 years, researchers have applied artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), representations (data, information, knowledge), question-answering, databases, human- computer interaction, and other techniques described by Licklider, to these challenges. We have a vast range of hardware and software services available, but without a more formal approach, will not enable adaptive self-organization and tailored exploration. The 5S framework [1-3, 12] can help us build, apply, and improve [9, 14] digital libraries to facilitate exploration [13], through a formal approach that will simplify such efforts, making them extensible through both human and computing agents. For example, to more easily build DLs, we propose collaboratively building knowledge graphs [8] - involving both User eXperience [4] designers, subject matter experts, and developers - that specify connections to services and workflows, enabling DL operation atop a workflow engine [6]. User exploration, additional help by UX designers, recommendations of adaptations of existing workflows, and AI-based optimizations and solutions to new problems, will all expand the knowledge graph to ensure new and more helpful assistance. When this is accomplished, we must teach and learn about this next generation of digital libraries, further developing suitable curriculum and educational modules, that rest upon a solid theoretical foundation, helping spread understanding of key concepts and best practices [10, 11]. © 2020.

As a step toward AI systems that can build similar mental models, we introduce GLUCOSE, a large-scale dataset of implicit commonsense causal knowledge, encoded as causal mini-theories about the world, each grounded in a narrative context. To construct GLUCOSE, we drew on cognitive psychology to identify ten dimensions of causal explanation, focusing on events, states, motivations, and emotions. Each GLUCOSE entry includes a story-specific causal statement paired with an inference rule generalized from the statement. This paper details two concrete contributions. First, we present our platform for effectively crowdsourcing GLUCOSE data at scale, which uses semi-structured templates to elicit causal explanations. Using this platform, we collected a total of 670K specific statements and general rules that capture implicit commonsense knowledge about everyday situations. Second, we show that existing knowledge resources and pretrained language models do not include or readily predict GLUCOSE's rich inferential content. However, when state-of-the-art neural models are trained on this knowledge, they can start to make commonsense inferences on unseen stories that match humans' mental models. © 2020 Association for Computational Linguistics","2-s2.0-85098784673"

Despite the excellent capability to rule-out CAD, CCTA may overestimate the degree of stenosis; furthermore, CCTA analysis can be time consuming, often requiring advanced postprocessing techniques. In consideration of the most recent ESC guidelines on CAD management, which will likely increase CCTA volume over the next years, new tools are necessary to shorten reporting time and improve the accuracy for the detection of ischemia-inducing coronary lesions. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) may provide a helpful tool in CCTA, improving the evaluation and quantification of coronary stenosis, plaque characterization, and assessment of myocardial ischemia. Furthermore, in comparison with existing risk scores, machine-learning algorithms can better predict the outcome utilizing both imaging findings and clinical parameters. Medical AI is moving from the research field to daily clinical practice, and with the increasing number of CCTA examinations, AI will be extensively utilized in cardiac imaging.

However, this test can take up to 2 d to complete, serial testing may be required to rule out the possibility of false negative results and there is currently a shortage of RT–PCR test kits, underscoring the urgent need for alternative methods for rapid and accurate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, CT alone may have limited negative predictive value for ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection, as some patients may have normal radiological findings at early stages of the disease. In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history and laboratory testing to rapidly diagnose patients who are positive for COVID-19. Among a total of 905 patients tested by real-time RT–PCR assay and next-generation sequencing RT–PCR, 419 (46.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a test set of 279 patients, the AI system achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 and had equal sensitivity as compared to a senior thoracic radiologist. The AI system also improved the detection of patients who were positive for COVID-19 via RT–PCR who presented with normal CT scans, correctly identifying 17 of 25 (68%) patients, whereas radiologists classified all of these patients as COVID-19 negative. When CT scans and associated clinical history are available, the proposed AI system can help to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 patients. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","2-s2.0-85085353104"

Use of Stochastic models that based on time series observations and do not require heavy calculations and complex relationships is developing. Recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have developed to improve the accuracy of sediment modeling. In this review study, the performances of the various types of AI models viz., ANN, GP, GEP, ANFIS, SVM, IBL, ABC, REPT, TLBO, decision tree and hybrid models viz., wavelet-AI, GP-AI are investigated as a means of prediction of sediment patterns in rivers. Published between 2001 and 2019, the 66 papers comprising the study deal with the usage of AI models in estimate of sediment and are undertaken in terms of data selection, modeling approaches, prediction time step, and modeling performance evaluation. This study presents an overview of AI techniques and a discussion of advantages to and applications of modeling sediment relations which to some extent have replaced time-consuming conventional mathematical techniques. However, the study discusses major challenges and prospective research opportunities. Comparison of the results produced by the models indicated an improvement in the prediction accuracy through the use of hybrid models. The most prominent feature of hybrid models is that they can provide more precise predictions for extremely high or low values, due to the utilization of the distributed information processing system and the non-linear transform involved. In the most recent articles in competition with wavelets an iterative procedure namely HHT introduced as effective filter for extracting the oscillatory-like features at different time scales. A review of published articles on sediment modeling showed the emergence of wavelet-based methods since 2008. No wavelet-AI based methods have been used in any of the articles reviewed so far. This subject was not investigated by any study in 2009. Between 2010 and 2019, 12 papers explored the use of a number of wavelet-AI based methods. About 19 percent (13 papers) of the studies used hybrid wavelet models among the articles studied. Of all the papers, only 6 papers investigated the performance of the models for the detection of hysteresis phenomenon. This study showed that AI models could be successfully employed to simulate the complex river sediment process in situations where explicit knowledge of internal sub-process is not required. This study also presents several new thinking in the related field of research to develop innovative methods and improve the quality of modeling. Future research efforts should be focused on formulating guidelines that help to develop AI-based models. © 2020","2-s2.0-85085544803"

Inclusion of additional knowledge such as ontology, logical rules and text improves the learning process of KGE models. One of the main characteristics of knowledge graphs (KGs) is the existence of relational patterns (e.g., symmetric and inverse relations) which usually remain unseen by the embedding models. Inclusion of logical rules provides embedding models with additional information about the patterns already present in the KGs. The injection of logical rules has not yet been studied in depth for KGE models. In this paper, we propose an approach for rule-based learning on top of the two embedding models namely RotatE and TransE within this scope of the paper. We first study the effect of rule injection in the performance of the selected models. Second, we explore how the removal of leakage from popular KGs such as FB15k and WN18 affects the results. By leakage we are referring to the patterns exist in the training set from the test set (e.g. if the test set contains (h, r, t) then it also contains t, r, h in the training set which is considered as a symmetric leakage where t, r and h refers to tail, relation and head respectively). Empirical results suggest that incorporation of logical rules in the training process improves the performance of KGE models. © 2020 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-85120680222"

This has posed new technological and regulatory challenges in order to address the complex safety, efficiency and sustainability requirements associated with UAS operations in an increasingly congested airspace. The growing need for trusted autonomy in UAS operations imposes demanding performance requirements on Navigation and Guidance Systems (NGS), both in terms of accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability. In most current NGS implementations, system autonomy is tightly constrained within a specified set of operational and environmental conditions through a large number of explicit rules. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods and the emergence of highly-parallelized processor boards with low form-factor has led to the opportunity to employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to enhance navigation system performance, particularly for small UAS (sUAS), which account for the majority of current and future unmanned aircraft use-cases. sUAS navigation systems typically employ diverse low Size, Weight, Power and Cost (SWaP-C) sensors such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, MEMS-IMUs, magnetometers, cameras and Lidars for localization, obstacle detection and avoidance. This paper presents a comprehensive review of conventional sUAS navigation systems, including aspects such as system architecture, sensing modalities and data-fusion algorithms. Additionally, performance monitoring and augmentation strategies are critically reviewed and assessed against current and future UAS Traffic Management (UTM) requirements. The primary focus is on the identification of key gaps in the literature where the use of AI-based methods can potentially enhance navigation performance. A critical review of AI-based methods and their application to sUAS navigation is conducted, along with an assessment of the performance benefits they provide over conventional navigation systems. Reviewed methods include but are not restricted to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) such as Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks (CNN and RNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and ensemble techniques. The key challenges associated with adapting these methods to address sUAS operational objectives are clearly identified. The review also covers the assurance of predictable, deterministic system behaviour which is a key requirement to support system certification. The review and analysis will inform the reader of the applicability of various AI/ML methods to sUAS navigation and autonomous system integrity monitoring, and its likely role in the ongoing UTM evolution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85087198702"

Colon capsule endoscopies (CCE) have been suggested as an alternative, although completion rates have been unsatisfactory. Introduction of artificial intelligence (AI)-based localization algorithms of the camera capsules may enable identification of incomplete CCE investigations overlapping with incomplete OCs. Objective: The study aims to investigate relative sensitivity of CCE compared with CTC following incomplete OC, investigate the completion rate when combining results from the incomplete OC and CCE, and develop a forward-tracking algorithm ensuring a safe completeness of combined investigations. Methods: In this prospective paired study, patients with indication for CTC following incomplete OC were included for CCE and CTC. Location of CCE abortion and OC abortion were registered to identify complete combined investigations. AI-based algorithm for localization of capsules were developed reconstructing the passage of the colon. Results: In 237 individuals with CTC indication; 105 were included, of which 97 underwent both a CCE and CTC. CCE was complete in 66 (68%). Including CCEs which reached most oral point of incomplete OC, 73 (75%) had complete colonic investigations; 78 (80%) had conclusive investigations. Relative sensitivity of CCE compared with CTC was 2.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.76;4.04) for polyps >5 mm and 1.91 (95% CI 1.18;3.09) for polyps >9 mm. An AI-based algorithm was developed. Conclusion: Sensitivity of CCE following incomplete OC was superior to CTC. Introducing and improving algorithm-based localization of capsule abortion may increase identification of overall complete investigation rates following incomplete OC.

AI employs machine learning techniques, which enable the system to automatically improve its performance by exposure to large amounts of data. However, this make its behavior largely unpredictable, even if all initial programming parameters are known. Such technological developments entail that space activities will be conducted with increased system autonomy. A significant part of the decision-making process throughout the mission will be shifted from humans to machines. Thus, questions arise on how AI impacts the current system of liability under international space law. This paper submits that there will be no problems for cases involving strict liability of the launching State. Nonetheless, cases that require 'fault' of the launching State will become (even) more difficult to handle, in view of the challenges in defining 'fault' and in establishing causal connection between the fault and the damage. Fault may be indicated by non-compliance with established international rules or codes of conduct, by insufficient regard of other States' interests under Art. IX OST, or by unreasonable behavior. These parameters are examined in relation to AI, alongside with additional AI-specific factors, which might relate to the quality of the training data, sufficient testing of the system (including proper function and interaction among its components), performance of necessary system updates, redundancy of systems, use of systems within their operational domains, possibility of human intervention, resilience in contingencies (e.g. solar storms, function in low power mode), etc. In the event that AI is used to support human decisions through recommendations, then human factors should also be considered, such as appropriate warnings and user-friendly system design. Moreover, explainability of AI decisions is highly desirable, but also hard to materialize owing to the complexity of AI systems. In any case, comparing AI behavior with human behavior should not be excluded, but extreme caution is required, because AI functions differently than the human mind and is meant to surpass human abilities. The paper concludes that it is necessary to establish international regulations on space activities, even in non-binding form, and international, performance-based safety standards. In view of the expressed aversion of States to any new internationally binding rules, any gaps in victim protection will have to be filled by national legislation and insurance. © Copyright 2020 by Stefan A.

Methods: This observational study included 315 consecutive, non-contrast-enhanced calcium scoring computed tomography (CSCT) scans. A semi-automatic and an automatic software obtained the Agatston score (AS), the volume score (VS), the mass score (MS), and the number of calcified coronary lesions. Semi-automatic and automatic analysis time were registered, including a manual double-check of the automatic results. Statistical analyses were Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (⍴), intra-class correlation (ICC), Bland Altman plots, weighted kappa analysis (κ), and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results: The correlation and agreement for the AS, VS, and MS were ⍴ = 0.935, 0.932, 0.934 (p < 0.001), and ICC = 0.996, 0.996, 0.991, respectively (p < 0.001). The correlation and agreement for the number of calcified lesions were ⍴ = 0.903 and ICC = 0.977 (p < 0.001), respectively. The Bland Altman mean difference and 1.96 SD upper and lower limits of agreements for the AS, VS, and MS were − 8.2 (− 115.1 to 98.2), − 7.4 (− 93.9 to 79.1), and − 3.8 (− 33.6 to 25.9), respectively. Agreement in risk category assignment was 89.5% and κ = 0.919 (p < 0.001). The median time for the semi-automatic and automatic method was 59 s (IQR 35–100) and 36 s (IQR 29–49), respectively (p < 0.001). Conclusions: There was an excellent correlation and agreement between the automatic software and the semi-automatic software for three CAC scores and the number of calcified lesions. Risk category classification was accurate but showing an overestimation bias tendency. Also, the automatic method was less time-demanding. Key Points: • Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is an excellent candidate for artificial intelligence (AI) development in a clinical setting. • An AI-based, automatic software obtained CAC scores with excellent correlation and agreement compared with a conventional method but was less time-consuming. © 2019, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85075234934"

This contribution outlines AI-based techniques for 3D point clouds and geospatial digital twins as generic components of geospatial AI. First, we briefly reflect on the term “AI” and outline technology developments needed to apply AI to IT solutions, seen from a software engineering perspective. Next, we characterize 3D point clouds as key category of geodata and their role for creating the basis for geospatial digital twins; we explain the feasibility of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches for 3D point clouds. In particular, we argue that 3D point clouds can be seen as a corpus with similar properties as natural language corpora and formulate a “Naturalness Hypothesis” for 3D point clouds. In the main part, we introduce a workflow for interpreting 3D point clouds based on ML/DL approaches that derive domain-specific and application-specific semantics for 3D point clouds without having to create explicit spatial 3D models or explicit rule sets. Finally, examples are shown how ML/DL enables us to efficiently build and maintain base data for geospatial digital twins such as virtual 3D city models, indoor models, or building information models. © 2020, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85080980476"

Such rigorously validated medical diagnostic AI systems hold great promise for improving access to care, increasing accuracy, and lowering cost, while enabling specialist physicians to provide the greatest value by managing and treating patients whose outcomes can be improved. Ensuring that autonomous AI provides these benefits requires evaluation of the autonomous AI's effect on patient outcome, design, validation, data usage, and accountability, from a bioethics and accountability perspective. We performed a literature review of bioethical principles for AI, and derived evaluation rules for autonomous AI, grounded in bioethical principles. The rules include patient outcome, validation, reference standard, design, data usage, and accountability for medical liability. Application of the rules explains successful US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) de novo authorization of an example, the first autonomous point-of-care diabetic retinopathy examination de novo authorized by the FDA, after a preregistered clinical trial. Physicians need to become competent in understanding the potential risks and benefits of autonomous AI, and understand its design, safety, efficacy and equity, validation, and liability, as well as how its data were obtained. The autonomous AI evaluation rules introduced here can help physicians understand limitations and risks as well as the potential benefits of autonomous AI for their patients. © 2020","2-s2.0-85083703254"

Hence, AI has to be designed, controlled, and utilized for humans. To be accepted in a human society, AI has to be armed with law and ethics, because law and ethics provide fundamental principles, rules, and guidance for interactions in a human society. Without them, a human society can hardly survive in a peaceful way. However, implementing ethics in AI systems is absolutely a challenge. There are several layers that need to be taken into consideration. There are dilemmas in each layer, making implementation even more complex and challenging. This paper intends to tackle this challenge. It starts with a hypothetical but possible case that an AI-enabled self-driving vehicle may encounter. It examines various dilemmas involved in this case, especially the ethical one. It reveals the ineffectiveness of the current approaches in dealing with the ethical dilemma. It then proposes a novel approach that fully utilizes both the unique strengths of AI systems and the unique strengths of humans in exploring paradigm-shift solutions in dealing with this type of dilemmas. As a result, ethics can be successfully implemented and dynamically executed in AI systems. © ECIAIR 2020.All right reserved.","2-s2.0-85097833167"

This article addresses this gap by identifying seven ethical factors that are essential for future AI4SG initiatives. The analysis is supported by 27 case examples of AI4SG projects. Some of these factors are almost entirely novel to AI, while the significance of other factors is heightened by the use of AI. From each of these factors, corresponding best practices are formulated which, subject to context and balance, may serve as preliminary guidelines to ensure that well-designed AI is more likely to serve the social good. © 2020, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85083167565"

Over the past decade, online condition monitoring of industrial machinery has become one of the major research areas in fault detection and diagnosis. There are different types of stator winding insulation faults, of which the current work is focused on the identification of stator winding inter-turn fault as it accounts for 37% of the overall machine failures. Also, this fault, if identified at its incipient stage, can predominantly improvise machine downtime and maintenance cost. The proposed work uses acquired experimental data from both healthy and faulty three-phase induction motor to train the neuro-fuzzy classifier for fault severity evaluation. It has been observed that AI-based neuro-fuzzy classifier is capable of generating rules and membership functions on its own with a given set of experimental data whereas fuzzy classifier requires manual intervention for defining rules and membership functions.

Observers' assessment results might differ even with the same dataset. While motion capture (MOCAP) systems have improved the speed and the accuracy of motion-data gathering, the algorithms used to compute assessments seem to rely on predefined conditions to perform them. Moreover, the authoring of these conditions is not always clear. Making use of artificial intelligence (AI), along with MOCAP systems, computerized ergonomic assessments can become more alike to human observation and improve over time, given proper training datasets. AI can assist ergonomic experts with posture detection, useful when using methods that require posture definition, such as Ovako Working Posture Assessment System (OWAS). This study aims to prove the usefulness of an AI model when performing ergonomic assessments and to prove the benefits of having a specialized database for current and future AI training. Several algorithms are trained, using Xsens MVN MOCAP datasets, and their performance within a use case is compared. AI algorithms can provide accurate posture predictions.

Despite the intensive support for building ML applications, there are still challenges when it comes to evaluating, assuring, and improving the quality or dependability. The difficulty stems from the unique nature of ML: namely, that the system behavior is derived from training data, not from logical design by human engineers. This leads to black-box and intrinsically imperfect implementations that invalidate many of the existing principles and techniques in traditional software engineering. In light of this situation, the Japanese industry has jointly worked on a set of guidelines for the quality assurance of AI systems (in the QA4AI consortium) from the viewpoint of traditional quality-assurance engineers and test engineers. We report the initial version of these guidelines, which cover a list of the quality evaluation aspects, a catalogue of current state-of-the-art techniques, and domain-specific discussions in four representative domains.

To date, however, systematic review of the literature on the impact of AI on ADRD management has been lacking. Objective: This paper aims to (1) identify and examine literature on AI that provides information to facilitate ADRD management by caregivers of individuals diagnosed with ADRD and (2) identify gaps in the literature that suggest future directions for research. Methods: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for conducting systematic literature reviews, during August and September 2019, we performed 3 rounds of selection. First, we searched predetermined keywords in PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus with Full Text, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and the ACM Digital Library. This step generated 113 nonduplicate results. Next, we screened the titles and abstracts of the 113 papers according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, after which 52 papers were excluded and 61 remained. Finally, we screened the full text of the remaining papers to ensure that they met the inclusion or exclusion criteria; 31 papers were excluded, leaving a final sample of 30 papers for analysis. Results: Of the 30 papers, 20 reported studies that focused on using AI to assist in activities of daily living. A limited number of specific daily activities were targeted. The studies' aims suggested three major purposes: (1) to test the feasibility, usability, or perceptions of prototype AI technology; (2) to generate preliminary data on the technology's performance (primarily accuracy in detecting target events, such as falls); and (3) to understand user needs and preferences for the design and functionality of to-be-developed technology. The majority of the studies were qualitative, with interviews, focus groups, and observation being their most common methods. Cross-sectional surveys were also common, but with small convenience samples. Sample sizes ranged from 6 to 106, with the vast majority on the low end. The majority of the studies were descriptive, exploratory, and lacking theoretical guidance. Many studies reported positive outcomes in favor of their AI technology's feasibility and satisfaction; some studies reported mixed results on these measures. Performance of the technology varied widely across tasks. Conclusions: These findings call for more systematic designs and evaluations of the feasibility and efficacy of AI-based interventions for caregivers of people with ADRD. These gaps in the research would be best addressed through interdisciplinary collaboration, incorporating complementary expertise from the health sciences and computer science/engineering-related fields.  © 2020 Bo Xie, Cui Tao, Juan Li, Robin C Hilsabeck, Alyssa Aguirre.","2-s2.0-85097476090"

Drawing from research and expert consultations conducted across the globe in recent years, this paper identifies key points of consensus on how humanitarian practitioners can ensure that AI augments - rather than undermines - human interests while being rights-respecting. Specifically, these consultations emphasized the necessity of an anchoring framework based on international human rights law as an essential baseline for ensuring that human interests are embedded in AI systems. Ethics, in addition, can play a complementary role in filling gaps and elevating standards above the minimum requirements of international human rights law. This paper summarizes the advantages of this framework, while also identifying specific tools and best practices that either already exist and can be adapted to the AI context, or that need to be created, in order to operationalize this human rights framework. As the COVID crisis has laid bare, AI will increasingly shape the global response to the world's toughest problems, especially in the development and humanitarian sector. To ensure that AI tools enable human progress and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, humanitarian actors need to be proactive and inclusive in developing tools, policies and accountability mechanisms that protect human rights. © The Author(s), 2021.

We begin by examining the validity of grounding standards that aim for international reach on human right agreements, and the need to accommodate variations in prioritization and tradeoffs in implementing rights in different societal and cultural settings. We then examine the major recent proposals from the OECD, the EU and the IEEE on ethical governance of Trustworthy AI systems in terms of their scope and use of normative language. From this analysis, we propose a preliminary minimal model for the functional roles relevant to Trustworthy AI as a framing for further standards development in this area. We also identify the different types of interoperability reference points that may exist between these functional roles and remark on the potential role they could play in future standardization. Finally we examine a current AI standardization effort under ISO/IEC JTC1 to consider how future Trustworthy AI standards may be able to build on existing standards in developing ethical guidelines and in particular on the ISO standard on Social Responsibility.

To address these challenges, we employ multiple Artificial Intelligence (AI) classifiers that rely on pattern recognitions instead of traditional operator-set thresholds. AI techniques, consisting of two-dimensional (2D) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Interface Systems (ANFIS), are used to mimic processes performed by operators during a rupture event. This includes both visualization (using CNN) and rule-based decision making (using ANFIS). The system provides a level of reasoning to an operator through the use of the rule-based AI system. Pump station sensor data is non-dimensionalized prior to AI processing, enabling application to pipeline configurations outside of the training data set. AI algorithms undergo testing and training using two data sets: laboratory-collected data that mimics transient pump-station operations and real operator data that includes Real Time Transient Model (RTTM) simulated ruptures. The use of non-dimensional sensor data enables the system to detect ruptures from pipeline data not used in the training process. Copyright © 2020 ASME","2-s2.0-85099786261"

This cohort includes giants like Google, Facebook, and Alibaba, and growing businesses such as Wayfair and Ocado. Every time we use their services, the same thing happens: Rather than relying on processes run by employees, the value we get is delivered by algorithms. Software is at the core of the enterprise, and humans are moved off to the side. This model frees firms from traditional operating constraints and enables them to compete in unprecedented ways. AI-driven processes can be scaled up very rapidly, allow for greater scope because they can be connected to many kinds of businesses, and offer very powerful opportunities for learning and improvement. And while the value of scale eventually begins to level off in traditional models, in AI-based ones, it never stops climbing. All of that allows AI-driven firms to quickly overtake traditional ones. As AI models blur the lines between industries, strategies are relying less on specialized expertise and differentiation based on cost, quality, and branding, and more on business network position, unique data, and the deployment of sophisticated analytics. © 2020, Harvard Business School Publishing.

Indeed, increased reliance on autonomy technologies is a key enabler of these future concepts. Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, which are at the heart of emerging autonomy technologies, are generally perceived as black boxes whose decisions are a result of complex rules learned on-the-fly. Unless these decisions are explained in a human understandable form, the end-users are less likely to accept them and certification personnel are less likely to clear these systems for field operation. Explainable AI (XAI) is an AI algorithm whose actions can be easily understood by humans. The research effort described in this paper developed EXplained Process and Logic of Artificial INtelligence Decisions (EXPLAIND)—a prototype tool for verification and validation of AI-based aviation systems. We provided a proof-of-concept for EXPLAIND by applying it to generate reliable, human-understandable explanations for decisions made by a NASA-developed aircraft trajectory anomaly detection AI algorithm. Cognitive walkthroughs of EXPLAIND’s explanation interface with controller subject matter experts demonstrated that EXPLAIND represents an important step towards user acceptance and certification of AI-based decision support tools (DSTs). © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

We posit that agents must be accountable and explainable by referring to which rules justify their decisions. The need for explanations is associated with user acceptance and trust. This paper's contribution is twofold: i) we propose an argumentation-based human-agent architecture to map human regulations into a culture for artificial agents with explainable behaviour. Our architecture leans on the notion of argumentative dialogues and generates explanations from the history of such dialogues; and ii) we validate our architecture with a user study in the context of human-agent path deconfliction. Our results show that explanations provide a significantly higher improvement in human performance when systems are more complex. Consequently, we argue that the criteria defining the need of explanations should also consider the complexity of a system. Qualitative findings show that when rules are more complex, explanations significantly reduce the perception of challenge for humans. © 2020 International Foundation for Autonomous.","2-s2.0-85096668412"

In the twenty-first century, intelligent decision support systems (IDSS) utilize artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance and improve support for decision-makers. Ethics, as the branch of philosophy dealing with concepts of right and wrong conduct, was solely attributed to human intelligence, behaviour or decision. With artificial intelligence-based systems, the notion AI Ethics (or machine ethics) refers to ethical decision-making by machines. Specifically, in the field of IDSS, where AI techniques participate (at least partially) in the decision-making process, it is of utmost importance to design such systems with ethical considerations. In this paper, we present a classification of ethical values as an underlying concept for a framework consisting in a set of rules that need to be part of any IDSS design. Applied to a decision process for candidate pre-selection (e.g. hiring), we illustrate the pitfalls that lead to biased decisions and methods for mitigation of “wrong decisions”, from an ethical point of view.

AI promises enormous benefits for economic growth, social development, as well as human well-being and safety improvement. However, the low-level of explainability, data biases, data security, data privacy, and ethical problems of AI-based technology pose significant risks for users, developers, humanity, and societies. As AI advances, one critical issue is how to address the ethical and moral challenges associated with AI. Even though the concept of “machine ethics” was proposed around 2006, AI ethics is still in the infancy stage. AI ethics is the field related to the study of ethical issues in AI. To address AI ethics, one needs to consider the ethics of AI and how to build ethical AI. Ethics of AI studies the ethical principles, rules, guidelines, policies, and regulations that are related to AI. Ethical AI is an AI that performs and behaves ethically. One must recognize and understand the potential ethical and moral issues that may be caused by AI to formulate the necessary ethical principles, rules, guidelines, policies, and regulations for AI (i.e., Ethics of AI). With the appropriate ethics of AI, one can then build AI that exhibits ethical behavior (i.e., Ethical AI). This paper will discuss AI ethics by looking at the ethics of AI and ethical AI.

Conventional Machine Learning methods such as random forest, support vector machine, back progradation neutral network have been tested throughout in lithofacies classification (Hall and Hall, 2017). However, poor performances were observed in depositional facies prediction as the later requires integration of more complex data such as depositional facies interpretation in core, wireline, biostratigraphy in the context of depositional units, not sample by sample data points. The limitation of data-driven classifier and the value of geological derived features in facies classifications was discussed in the literature (Halotel et al., 2020). In order to improve the classifier performance, a novel hybrid approach was implemented, which involved an automatic depositional unit breakdown, well log feature extractions, machine learning core-log models and a rule based expert system. In this paper, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system was employed that integrates machine learning with an expert system to predict depositional facies and tested its reliability versus facies interpretations made from conventional cores in test wells. In the prediction method, data samples were depositional units derived from Gamma Ray value changes that were integrated with core and biostratigraphic data. These were then passed through an expert system containing a set of fuzzy rules to yield final probabilities for each of the 35 depositional facies stored in a library. The AI system helped to produce multiple scenarios with qualify uncertainty, consistent depositional facies classification based on depositional facies observed in core, biostratigraphy and wireline logs. Depositional facies in the aforementioned reservoir were predicted with the AI system for the cored intervals in X1 and X2 using only well logs and biostratigraphic data as input. The predicted facies were in strong agreement with the core interpretations as both methods concluded that the depositional environment was a marine delta. The AI prediction assigned a higher proportion of the X2 succession to the ""Marine Delta"" depositional facies than it did for the X1 core; the facies difference in the two wells was subtle and not recognized by the core interpretation. Seismic attributes suggested that the more variable facies succession that AI predicted for X1 may have geological significance. The AI tool generated reliable and consistent results and appeared capable of reducing the uncertainties of predicting facies distribution and the subsequent development of conceptual depositional models.

Traditional measures such as confidence intervals may be insufficient due to noise, limited data and confounding. In this paper we develop a method that could serve as a hybrid human-AI system, to enable human experts to analyze the validity of policy evaluation estimates. This is accomplished by highlighting observations in the data whose removal will have a large effect on the OPE estimate, and formulating a set of rules for choosing which ones to present to domain experts for validation. We develop methods to compute exactly the influence functions for fitted Q-evaluation with two different function classes: kernel-based and linear least squares, as well as importance sampling methods. Experiments on medical simulations and real-world intensive care unit data demonstrate that our method can be used to identify limitations in the evaluation process and make evaluation more robust.

Unfortunately, state-of-the-art data-driven AI techniques such as deep learning are too costly in terms of hardware and energy requirements for Edge Computing (EC) devices. Recently, Cellular Automata (CA) have been proposed as a feasible way to implement Reservoir Computing (RC) systems in which the automaton rule is fixed and the training is performed using a linear regression model. In this work we show that Reservoir Computing based on CA may arise as a promising AI alternative for devices operating at the edge due to its intrinsic simplicity. For this purpose, a new low-power CA-based reservoir hardware is proposed and implemented in a FPGA (known as ReCA circuitry). The use of Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA) is able to further simplify the RC structure to implement a power efficient AI system suitable to be implemented in EC applications. Experiments have been conducted on the well-known MNIST handwritten digits database, obtaining competitive results in terms of processing time, circuit area, power and inference accuracy. © 1968-2012 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85079671255"

This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials–Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trial protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials–Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted upon by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items that were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations for the handling of input and output data, the human–AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial. © 2020, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85090498378"

By pushing AI at the network edge, close to the large amount of raw input data, the traffic traversing the core network as well as the inference latency can be reduced. Despite such neat benefits, the actual deployment of edge AI across distributed nodes raises novel challenges to be addressed, such as the need to enforce proper addressing and discovery procedures, to identify AI components, and to chain them in an interoperable manner. Named Data Networking (NDN) has been recently argued as one of the main enablers of network and computing convergence, which edge AI should build upon. However, the peculiarities of such a new paradigm entails to go a step further. In this paper we disclose the potential of NDN to support the orchestration of edge AI. Several motivations are discussed, as well as the challenges which serve as guidelines for progress beyond the state of the art in this topic. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85093846473"

Materials and Methods: AI-based CT FFR from triple-rule-out CT angiography data sets was retrospectively obtained in 159 of 271 eligible patients (102 men; mean age, 57.0 years ± 9.7 [standard deviation]) presenting to the ED with ACP. The agreement between CT FFR (≤ 0.80) and stenosis at triple-rule-out CT angiography (≥ 50%), as well as downstream cardiac diagnostic testing, was in-vestigated. Furthermore, the predictive value of CT FFR for coronary revascularization and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was assessed over a 1-year follow-up period. Results: CT FFR and triple-rule-out CT angiography demonstrated agreement in severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) in 52% (82 of 159) of all cases. CT FFR of 0.80 and less served as a better predictor for coronary revascularization and MACE than stenosis of 50% and greater at triple-rule-out CT angiography (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval: 1.4, 8.2 vs odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval: 0.9, 5.3) (P <.01). In the subgroup of patients with additional noninvasive cardiac testing (94 of 159), there was higher agreement as to the presence or absence of significant disease with CT FFR (55%) than with coronary triple-rule-out CT angiography (47%) (P =.23). Conclusion: CT FFR derived from triple-rule-out CT angiography was a better predictor for coronary revascularization and MACE and showed better agreement with additional diagnostic testing than triple-rule-out CT angiography. Therefore, CT FFR may improve the specificity in identifying patients with ACP with significant CAD in the ED setting and reduce unnecessary downstream testing. © RSNA, 2020.","2-s2.0-85112669803"

These (then-) futuristic ideas were steadily incorporated into very real and current technology. Combined with Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) technology, products and machines disrupt the idea of agency and the involvement of human beings in manufacturing and provision of services. How should liability be constructed when there is no apparent agency or personhood or when actions are almost inherently unforeseeable? More specifically, in the context of AI-based robots, do models of products liability or other tort liability fit the new framework? This Article seeks to explain why current law and doctrine, such as products liability and negligence, cannot provide an adequate framework for these technological advancements, mainly due to the lack of personhood, agency, and the inability to predict and explain robot behavior. Zooming out from specific doctrines, the Article also suggests that none of the three main liability regimes-strict liability, negligence, and no-fault mandatory insurance-adequately resolves the challenges of AI-based robots. Ultimately, this Article aims at suggesting supplementary rules that, together with existing liability models, could provide better legal structures that fit AI-based robots. Such supplementary rules will function as quasi-safe harbors or predetermined levels of care. Meeting them would shift the burden back to current tort doctrines. Failing to meet such rules would lead to liability. Such safe harbors may include a monitoring duty, built-in emergency brakes, and ongoing support and patching duties. The argument is these supplementary rules could be used as a basis for presumed negligence that complements the existing liability models. If adopted, they could establish clear rules or best practices that determine the scope of potential liability of designers, operators, and end-users of AI-based robots. © 2020 University of Illinois College of Law.

AI-based tools may improve prognosis, diagnostics, and care planning. It is believed that AI will be an integral part of healthcare services in the near future and will be incorporated into several aspects of clinical care. Thus, many technology companies and governmental projects have invested in producing AI-based clinical tools and medical applications. Patients can be one of the most important beneficiaries and users of AI-based applications whose perceptions may affect the widespread use of AI-based tools. Patients should be ensured that they will not be harmed by AI-based devices, and instead, they will be benefited by using AI technology for healthcare purposes. Although AI can enhance healthcare outcomes, possible dimensions of concerns and risks should be addressed before its integration with routine clinical care. Methods: We develop a model mainly based on value perceptions due to the specificity of the healthcare field. This study aims at examining the perceived benefits and risks of AI medical devices with clinical decision support (CDS) features from consumers' perspectives. We use an online survey to collect data from 307 individuals in the United States. Results: The proposed model identifies the sources of motivation and pressure for patients in the development of AI-based devices. The results show that technological, ethical (trust factors), and regulatory concerns significantly contribute to the perceived risks of using AI applications in healthcare. Of the three categories, technological concerns (i.e., performance and communication feature) are found to be the most significant predictors of risk beliefs. Conclusions: This study sheds more light on factors affecting perceived risks and proposes some recommendations on how to practically reduce these concerns. The findings of this study provide implications for research and practice in the area of AI-based CDS. Regulatory agencies, in cooperation with healthcare institutions, should establish normative standard and evaluation guidelines for the implementation and use of AI in healthcare. Regular audits and ongoing monitoring and reporting systems can be used to continuously evaluate the safety, quality, transparency, and ethical factors of AI-based services.  © 2020 The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85088428041"

This literature review aims to summarize progress in habitability research and explore implications for the design of current AI-enabled conversational systems. We found that i) the definitions of habitability focus mostly on matching between user expectations and system capabilities by employing well-balanced restrictions on language use; ii) there are two comprehensive design perspectives on different domains of habitability; iii) there is one standardized questionnaire with a sub-scale to measure habitability in a limited way.

Humans make many complex decisions that rely on their subjective preferences, but their decisions are usually also constrained by these ethical priorities. Hence it is essential to equip AI systems with the tools to evaluate whether or not preferences are compatible with these other priorities. In computer science, the Conditional Preference networks (CP-nets), which graphically represent conditional and qualitative preference relations, can be used to model, combine, and compare subjective preferences and ethical priorities. This chapter proposes that one can use CP-nets to measure the distance between an agent’s subjective preference and the ethical principles of the agent’s community in order to ensure that the decisions of an AI system are aligned with a given set of ethical priorities. © Oxford University Press 2020.","2-s2.0-85111876259"

Explainable AI (XAI in short) is expected to endow AI systems with explanation ability when interacting with humans. This paper describes how to provide kids with natural explanations, i.e., explanations verbalized in Natural Language, in the context of identifying/recognizing roles of basketball players. Semantic grounding is achieved through fuzzy concepts such as tall or short. Selected players are automatically classified by an ensemble of three different decision trees and one fuzzy rule-based classifier. All the single classifiers were first trained with the open source Weka software and then natural explanations were generated by the open source web service ExpliClas. The Human-Computer Interaction interface is implemented in Scratch, that is a visual programming language adapted to kids. The developed Scratch program is used for dissemination purposes when high-school teenagers visit the Research Center in Intelligent Technologies of the University of Santiago de Compostela.

Subsequently, publication counts applying machine learning methods have risen, with different data modalities, mathematically distinct models, and samples of varying size being used to train and test models with the promise of clinical translation. Consequently, and in part due to the preliminary nature of such works, many studies have reported largely varying degrees of accuracy, raising concerns over systematic overestimation and methodological inconsistencies. Furthermore, a lack of procedural evaluation guidelines for non-expert medical professionals and funding bodies leaves many in the field with no means to systematically evaluate the claims, maturity, and clinical readiness of a project. Given the potential of machine learning methods to transform patient care, albeit, contingent on the rigor of employed methods and their dissemination, we deem it necessary to provide a review of current methods, recommendations, and future directions for applied machine learning in psychiatry. In this review we will cover issues of best practice for model training and evaluation, sources of systematic error and overestimation, model explainability vs. trust, the clinical implementation of AI systems, and finally, future directions for our field. © 2019, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85073742498"

Concerns have been raised over the ethical aspects of these systems for example in relation to data privacy, or material harm in the case of cyber-physical systems. Though academic activity in the area has grown recently, much of the current corpus consists of theoretical and conceptual studies. Attempts to bring this on-going discussion into practice have been primarily made in the form of various guidelines for ethical development of AI systems. However, these guidelines have not been adopted out on the field. The current situation in the area calls for more actionable methods for AI ethics, focusing on the point of view of developers. In this paper, we discuss current methods for implementing ethics in different contexts and then provide an introduction to a tutorial on a developer-focused method for implementing AI ethics, the Ethics Card Deck. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","2-s2.0-85076153467"

Given the ubiquitous smart mobile gadgets and IoT devices, it is expected that a majority of intelligent applications will be deployed at the edge of wireless networks. This trend has generated strong interest in realizing an ""intelligent edge"" to support AI-enabled applications at various edge devices. Accordingly, a new research area, called edge learning, has emerged, which crosses and revolutionizes two disciplines: wireless communication and machine learning. A major theme in edge learning is to overcome the limited computing power, as well as limited data, at each edge device. This is accomplished by leveraging the mobile edge computing platform and exploiting the massive data distributed over a large number of edge devices. In such systems, learning from distributed data and communicating between the edge server and devices are two critical and coupled aspects, and their fusion poses many new research challenges. This article advocates a new set of design guidelines for wireless communication in edge learning, collectively called learning- driven communication. Illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of these design guidelines. Unique research opportunities are identified. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85078757648"

Even with careful review of the algorithms and data sets, it may not be possible to delete all unwanted bias, particularly because AI systems learn from historical data, which encodes historical biases. In this paper, we propose a set of processes that companies can use to mitigate and manage three general classes of bias: those related to mapping the business intent into the AI implementation, those that arise due to the distribution of samples used for training, and those that are present in individual input samples. While there may be no simple or complete solution to this issue, best practices can be used to reduce the effects of bias on algorithmic outcomes. � 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 License.","2-s2.0-85066905886"

While there have been several efforts around designing dialogue systems and conversation flows, little information is available about technical concepts to extract critical information for addressing the users’ needs. For conversational VUIs to function appropriately as a decision aid, artificial intelligence (AI) that recognizes and supports diverse user decision strategies is a critical need. Following the design principle proposed by Kwon et al. [1] regarding the conversational flow between the user and conversational VUI, we developed an AI-based mobile-decision-aid (MODA) that predictively models and addresses users’ decision strategies to facilitate users’ in-store shopping decision process. In this paper, technical details about how MODA processes users’ natural language queries and generate the most appropriate and intelligent recommendations have been discussed. This developmental approach provides broad implications to conversational VUIs for diverse complex decision-making contexts and decision-makers with a critical need for decision assistants. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","2-s2.0-85069670666"

Due to a lack of knowledge to support functional reasoning from the behaviors of constituent basic mechanisms to the whole functional behaviors of complex mechanisms, the AI-based type synthesis of compound mechanisms is still a hard challenge. In this paper, a grammar-based functional synthesis approach is proposed for carrying out the type synthesis of complex mechanisms. The functional synthesis rules, in which the functional requirements and the topological connections among functional members are included, are defined with the aid of nine kinds of common functional requirements that are primarily exhibited by complex mechanical systems. Through assigning a function as well as topological connections to each element in the graphic carrier according to the grammar-based functional synthesis rules, the type synthesis process for complex mechanisms is carried out automatically. Since the divergence creative design technique is applied, this system can efficiently expand the synthesis solution space of complex mechanisms, and more innovative design schemes for complex mechanisms can be figured out. For extremely complex mechanisms, through dividing the design problem into several parts, and doing logical operation to each part respectively, the function-based synthesis for complex mechanisms can also be solved by combing the generated schemes from each part. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2-s2.0-85067544917"

The robot system includes metric and semantic mapping, several navigation modes (way-point navigation, person following and multi-sensor obstacle detection and avoidance), vision-based object detection, recognition, servoing and grasping, speech understanding, task planning and task execution. The robot system is mostly activated by speech commands from a human, and these commands, after being interpreted, are executed by the robot sub-systems, coordinated by a task executor. Lessons learned during the development and use of this system, which are useful as guidelines for the development of similar robot systems, are provided.

Deep learning has outperformed conventional machine learning methods in most image-based applications. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have seen some popularity in radiomics, since they do not require hand-crafted features and can automatically extract features during the learning process. In this regard, it is observed that CNN based radiomics could provide state-of-the-art results in neuro-oncology, similar to the recent success of such methods in a wide spectrum of medical image analysis applications.

In this paper, we discuss a design fiction that closes this research gap. The descriptions and results of the study are purely fictitious. Excluded is the State of the Art as well as the description of the legal situation of prisons in Germany. The analysis of the fictional study data designed here thus refers to the real world in order to derive ethical guidelines and draw practical conclusions. It is our intention to use these results as a possible basis for further research. The paper presents results of an explorative study dealing with the design, development and evaluation of an AI-based Smart Mirror System, Prison AI 2.0, in a German prison. Prison AI 2.0 was developed for daily use and voluntarily tested by eight prisoners over a period of 12 months to gain insight into their individual and social impact, with an emphasis on its ability to actively support rehabilitation. Based on qualitative data, our findings suggest that intelligent AI-based devices can actually help promote such an outcome. Our results also confirm the valuable impact of (Psychosocial) ICT on the psychological, social and individual aspects of prison life, and in particular how prisoners used the Smart Mirror system to improve and maintain their cognitive, mental and physical state and to restore social interactions with the outside world. With the presentation of these results we want to initiate discussions about the use of ICT by prisoners in closed prisons in order to identify opportunities and risks.

In this study, we aimed to explore the accuracy and interrater variability of pulmonologists when interpreting PFTs compared with artificial intelligence (AI)-based software that was developed and validated in more than 1500 historical patient cases. 120 pulmonologists from 16 European hospitals evaluated 50 cases with PFT and clinical information, resulting in 6000 independent interpretations. The AI software examined the same data. American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines were used as the gold standard for PFT pattern interpretation. The gold standard for diagnosis was derived from clinical history, PFT and all additional tests. The pattern recognition of PFTs by pulmonologists (senior 73%, junior 27%) matched the guidelines in 74.4±5.9% of the cases (range 56-88%). The interrater variability of κ=0.67 pointed to a common agreement. Pulmonologists made correct diagnoses in 44.6±8.7% of the cases (range 24-62%) with a large interrater variability (κ=0.35). The AI-based software perfectly matched the PFT pattern interpretations (100%) and assigned a correct diagnosis in 82% of all cases (p<0.0001 for both measures). The interpretation of PFTs by pulmonologists leads to marked variations and errors. AI-based software provides more accurate interpretations and may serve as a powerful decision support tool to improve clinical practice. Copyright © ERS 2019","2-s2.0-85064829943"

With the continuous growth of the number of design techniques, the selection of appropriate ones becomes more difficult, especially for design novices with limited knowledge and expertise. In order to support the selection process, we propose design principles for the development of an advisory platform that interacts with design novices to suggest design techniques for different design situations using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Specifically, we leverage conversational agents, recommender techniques, and taxonomic background knowledge to conceptualize and implement an AI-based advisory platform. Following a design science research methodology, we contribute design knowledge for the class of advanced advisory platforms. Furthermore, from a practical point of view, we help design novices with our implemented advisory platform in the contextualized selection process of design techniques. © 27th European Conference on Information Systems - Information Systems for a Sharing Society, ECIS 2019.

Moreover, with proliferation of AI based solutions in areas such as hiring, lending, criminal justice, healthcare, and education, the resulting personal and professional implications of AI are far-reaching. The dominant role played by AI models in these domains has led to a growing concern regarding potential bias in these models, and a demand for model transparency and interpretability [6]. In addition, model explainability is a prerequisite for building trust and adoption of AI systems in high stakes domains requiring reliability and safety such as healthcare [1] and automated transportation, and critical industrial applications with significant economic implications such as predictive maintenance, exploration of natural resources, and climate change modeling. As a consequence, AI researchers and practitioners have focused their attention on explainable AI to help them better trust and understand models at scale [8, 9, 19]. The challenges for the research community include (i) defining model explainability, (ii) formulating explainability tasks for understanding model behavior and developing solutions for these tasks, and finally (iii) designing measures for evaluating the performance of models in explainability tasks. In this tutorial, we will present an overview of model interpretability and explainability in AI [4], key regulations/laws, and techniques/tools for providing explainability as part of AI/ML systems [7]. Then, we will focus on the application of explainability techniques in industry, wherein we present practical challenges/ guidelines for using explainability techniques effectively and lessons learned from deploying explainable models for several web-scale machine learning and data mining applications. We will present case studies across different companies, spanning application domains such as search and recommendation systems, sales, lending, and fraud detection. Finally, based on our experiences in industry, we will identify open problems and research directions for the data mining/machine learning community. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","2-s2.0-85071169118"

This chapter examines AI systems in public administration and raises the question of what guidelines already exist and what trends are emerging. After defining AI and providing some examples from government and administration, identify ethics and politics as possible points of reference for guidelines.

Accordingly, being able to explain the reason for an AI decision is becoming important to ensure the secure and safe use of AI techniques. Thus, we, the Special Interest Group on Semantic Web and Ontology of the Japanese Society for AI, organized a challenge calling for techniques that reason and/or estimate which characters are criminals while providing a reasonable explanation based on an open knowledge graph of a well-known Sherlock Holmes mystery story. This paper presents a summary report of the first challenge held in 2018, including the knowledge graph construction, the techniques proposed for reasoning and/or estimation, the evaluation metrics, and the results. The first prize went to an approach that formalized the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem and solved it using a lightweight formal method; the second prize went to an approach that used SPARQL and rules; the best resource prize went to a submission that constructed word embedding of characters from all sentences of Sherlock Holmes novels; and the best idea prize went to a discussion multi-agents model.

Epistemic information concerns facts, including how things are in the world, and ethical values concern how actions should be taken. The operation of artificial intelligence (AI) is based on facts, but it require values. A critical question here regards Hume’s Guillotine, which claims that one cannot derive values from facts. Hume’s Guillotine appears to divide AI systems into two ethical categories: weak and strong.

We propose a semi-interactive course where the students have to develop applications for solving real world problems by using various intelligent tools. We try to integrate these two disciplines, since both deal with modeling of the real case studies, sharing some common elements. We report on a study that we conducted on observing student teams as they develop AI-based applications. We validate the proposed semi-interactive course by using various criteria. In addition, we checked if some best practices from industrial teams are followed by our students.; The current study presents the experience gained while introducing a course with two main purposes: i) use of AI methods and algorithms in solving real life problems and ii) integrate AI specific solutions in software systems. We explained the principle in designing the course content, with a special attention dedicated to the applicative part. We described in detail how the application stages interleaves AI tasks (model representation, training, statistical analysis) with SE tasks (requirements engineering, SE processes, project management). In the end, we give an overview of the course evaluation.

As we anticipate a rapid increase in artificial intelligence (AI), we may soon find ourselves dealing with fully autonomous technology with the capacity to cause harm and injuries. What then? Who is going to be held accountable if AI systems harm us? Currently there is no answer to this question and the existing regulatory framework falls short in addressing the accountability regime of autonomous systems. This paper analyses criminal liability of AI systems, evaluated under the existing rules of criminal law. It highlights the social and legal implications of the current criminal liability regime as it is applied to the complex nature of industrial robots. Finally, the paper explores whether corporate liability is a viable option and what legal standards are possible for imposing criminal liability on the companies who deploy AI systems. The paper reveals that traditional criminal law and legal theory are not well positioned to answer the questions at hand, as there are many practical problems that require further evaluation. I have demonstrated that with the development of AI, more questions will surface and legal frameworks will inevitably need to adapt. The conclusions of this paper could be the basis for further research. © 2020, Masaryk University Journal of Law and Technology. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-85087649303"

This study had been originally carried out as a project of a research proposed on behalf of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, from 1999 to 2004. This nationwide multicenter study on AIs included 3,672 cases with clinically diagnosed AIs, involving 1,874 males and 1,738 females, with mean age 58.1 ± 13.0 years (mean ± SD). In the present study, we focused on the investigation of the real prevalence of various adrenal disorders with AI. The mean nodule size of AI based on computed tomography was 3.0 ± 2.0 cm. Compared to non-functioning adenomas (NFAs), tumor diameters were significantly larger in adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs), pheochromocytomas, cortisol-producing adenomas (CPAs), myelolipomas, metastatic tumors, cysts, and ganglioneuromas (p < 0.01). Endocrinological evaluations demonstrated that 50.8% of total AIs were non-functioning adenomas, while 10.5%, including 3.6% with subclinical Cushing’s syndrome, were reported as CPAs, 8.5% as pheochromocytomas, and 5.1% as aldosterone-producing adenomas. ACCs were accounted for 1.4% (50 cases) among our series of AIs. In conclusion, while almost 50 % of AIs are non-functional adenomas, we must be particularly careful as AIs include pheochromocytomas or adrenal carcinomas, because they may be asymptomatic. To our knowledge, this is the first and the largest investigation of AI, thus providing basic information for the establishment of clinical guidelines for the management of AI. ©The Japan Endocrine Society.","2-s2.0-85081070906"

One such challenge is the increasing prevalence of AI systems in political decision-making, which is often considered as a threat to democracy. But what exactly is lost when certain aspects of political decision-making are handed over to AI systems? To answer this question, I discuss an extreme case in which all political decisions are made by intelligent algorithms that function without human supervision. I will call this case Rule by Algorithms. I consider the epistocratic argument for Rule by Algorithms according to which as long as algorithms can be expected to produce better outcomes than human rulers, we have a good reason to abandon democracy for algorithmic rule. Some authors attempt to resist such conclusions by appealing to the notion of public justification. I argue that these attempts to refute Rule by Algorithms are ultimately unsuccessful. I offer an alternative argument according to which Rule by Algorithms should be rejected because it imposes impermissible constraints on our freedom. The discussion of this extreme case provides valuable insights into the challenges of AI in politics. © 2019 Gondolat Publishers. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-85082123562"

The design process and know-how of engineers is strongly individual and a rule-based description of their approach can often not be done at all or only with high effort. Existing knowledge can therefore only be passed on to other engineers with difficulty, which in particular increases the effort required for familiarisation. A further problem is the lack of an overview of existing components within a company, which very often leads to multiple designs and unnecessary waste of time for the engineer. The aim of this approach is to extract the implicit knowledge from existing CAD models with the aid of machine learning methods and thus to make it formalizable. In addition, a suitable classification and similarity analysis should quickly point out existing components. For this purpose, an AI-based assistance system is to be created. Based on the existing database, the assistant first points out to the engineer already existing, but very similar components. For that, the component type currently in construction firstly is identified and then very similar components are searched within the detected scale that are finally suggested to the engineer. The engineer now only has to parameterize the proposed components according to his application. In a further step, the assistant should also be able to suggest useful next design steps, which it has learned on the basis of the CAD data already available and their design history. The implicit experience knowledge that is contained in the existing CAD models thus ensures a design suitable for production and the avoidance of errors in the design. © 2019 The Authors.

Urban drainage systems conveying stormwater out of cities are key infrastructure elements for flood mitigation. This study develops an intelligent urban flood drainage system accounting for carryover storage through optimizing the multi-objective operation rules of pumping stations for effectual flood management in Taipei City. The Yu-Cheng pumping station constitutes the study case, and a large number of datasets collected from 17 typhoon/storm events are adopted for model construction and validation. Three objective functions are designed to minimize: (1) the sum of water level fluctuations in the flood storage pond (FSP); (2) the sum of peak FSP water levels; and (3) the mean absolute difference of pump switches between two consecutive times along operation sequence. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is applied to searching the Pareto-optimal solutions that optimize the trade-off between the objectives. We next formulate the optimal operation rules through a two-tier sorting process based on a compromised Pareto-optimal solution. The comparison of the simulated results obtained from both the optimal operation rules and current operation rules indicate that the optimal operation rules outperform current operation rules for all three objectives, with improvement rates reaching 43% (OBJ1), 3% (OBJ2) and 71% (OBJ3), respectively. We demonstrate that the derived intelligent urban flood drainage system can serve as reliable and efficient operational strategies for urban flood management and flood risk mitigation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85067689168"

Similarities between the settled case law argument and the classical precedent model provide a space for convergence which will result from the widespread - as it is anticipated - use of the AI software. In both types of legal systems AI will draw conclusions as to the content of applicable law, based on analysis of previous case law. AI will alter the judiciary factors, replacing the previous case law and doctrine practice in common law and statutory law systems with a new, universal method. The role of a lawyer will not be to independently interpret the law and substitute the factual condition against the hypothesis of a particular rules, but to supervise the reasoning carried out in this respect by AI from the perspective of human values (the axiological-humanistic perspective). The courts of higher instance will be exposed as those that fill the system with axiology and human sensitivity, modifying thereby the work of AI based on their case law.Development of AI will most probably result in homogenization of the models of application of law, the works of lawyers and the systems of administration of justice, as well as in change of the role of judiciary.

This study was performed to develop an automatic and accurate imaging processing technique system, allowing this system to read computed tomography (CT) images correctly and make diagnosis of pancreatic cancer faster.Methods:The establishment of the artificial intelligence (AI) system for pancreatic cancer diagnosis based on sequential contrast-enhanced CT images were composed of two processes: training and verification. During training process, our study used all 4385 CT images from 238 pancreatic cancer patients in the database as the training data set. Additionally, we used VGG16, which was pre-trained in ImageNet and contained 13 convolutional layers and three fully connected layers, to initialize the feature extraction network. In the verification experiment, we used sequential clinical CT images from 238 pancreatic cancer patients as our experimental data and input these data into the faster region-based convolution network (Faster R-CNN) model that had completed training. Totally, 1699 images from 100 pancreatic cancer patients were included for clinical verification.Results:A total of 338 patients with pancreatic cancer were included in the study. The clinical characteristics (sex, age, tumor location, differentiation grade, and tumor-node-metastasis stage) between the two training and verification groups were insignificant. The mean average precision was 0.7664, indicating a good training effect of the Faster R-CNN. Sequential contrast-enhanced CT images of 100 pancreatic cancer patients were used for clinical verification. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve calculated according to the trapezoidal rule was 0.9632. It took approximately 0.2 s for the Faster R-CNN AI to automatically process one CT image, which is much faster than the time required for diagnosis by an imaging specialist.Conclusions:Faster R-CNN AI is an effective and objective method with high accuracy for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.Trial Registration:ChiCTR1800017542; http://www.chictr.org.cn. © 2019 The Chinese Medical Association, produced by Wolters Kluwer, Inc.","2-s2.0-85077072164"

However, the clear benefits offered to patients are accompanied not only by general limitations typical of the application of AI systems but also by challenges that specifically characterize the operationalization of the concepts of disease and health. Traditionally, these challenges have been dealt with in the physician-patient relationship in both medical ethics and civil law. The potential for incorrect decisions (and the question of who is responsible for such decisions) in cases where AI is used in a medical context calls for a differentiated implementation of medical ethical principles and a graduated model of liability law. Nevertheless, on closer examination of both fields covering relevant obligations towards patients and users against the backdrop of current medical use cases of AI, it seems that despite a certain level of differentiation in the assignment of responsibilities through rules on liability, those affected, in the end, are generally left to deal with any AI-specific risks and damages on their own. The role played by the physician in all this remains unclear. Taking into account the physician-patient relationship as a contractual obligation in a broad sense can assist in clarifying physicians’ roles and determining their duties in a sustainable and patient-friendly manner when applying AI-based medical systems. This can contribute to reinforcing their established ethical and legal status in the context of AI applications. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","2-s2.0-85085440893"

The disruptive technologies AI is based on (as well as respective applications) are likely to influence the competition on and for various markets in due course. The handling of opportunities and threats re AI are so far still an open question-and research on the competitive effects of AI has just commenced recently. Statements about AI and the corresponding effects are thereby necessarily only of a temporary nature. From a jurisprudential point of view, it is however important to underline (not only) the framework for AI provided by competition law. On the basis of the 9th amendment of the German Act Against Restraints of Competition (ARC) 2017, German competition law seems to be-to a large extent-adequately prepared for the phenomenon of AI. Nevertheless, considering the characteristics of AI described in this paper, at least the interpretation of German (and European) competition law rules requires an ‘update’. In particular, tacit collusion as well as systematic predispositions of AI applications re market abuse and cartelization analyzed in this paper are to be pictured. Additionally, this paper stresses that further amendments to (European and German) competition law rules should be examined with respect to the liability for AI and law enforcement, whereby the respective effects on innovation and the market themselves will have to be considered carefully. Against this background, this paper argues that strict liability for AI might lead to negative effects on innovation and discusses a limited liability re public sanctions in analogy to intermediary liability concepts developed in tort law, unfair competition law and intellectual property law. Addressing the topic of a ‘legal personality’ for AI-based autonomous systems, this paper finally engages with the consequences of such a status for competition law liability. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","2-s2.0-85085460423"

This tries to deter AI systems (and research effort) from specialising to a single task, and encourage them to be prepared to solve previously unseen tasks. It is unclear, however, whether the methods with best performance are actually those that are most general and, in perspective, whether the trend moves towards more general AI systems. This question has a striking similarity with the analysis of the so-called positive manifold and general factors in the area of human intelligence. In this paper, we first show how the existence of a manifold (positive average pairwise task correlation) can also be analysed in AI, and how this relates to the notion of agent generality, from the individual and the populational points of view. From the populational perspective, we analyse the following question: is this manifold correlation higher for the most or for the least able group of agents? We contrast this analysis with one of the most controversial issues in human intelligence research, the so-called Spearman’s Law of Diminishing Returns (SLODR), which basically states that the relevance of a general factor diminishes for most able human groups. We perform two empirical studies on these issues in AI. We analyse the results of the 2015 general video game AI (GVGAI) competition, with games as tasks and “controllers” as agents, and the results of a synthetic setting, with modified elementary cellular automata (ECA) rules as tasks and simple interactive programs as agents. In both cases, we see that SLODR does not appear. The data, and the use of just two scenarios, does not clearly support the reverse either, a Universal Law of Augmenting Returns (ULOAR), but calls for more experiments on this question. © 2019 AI Access Foundation.

With accelerated video surge, emotion understanding remains challenging due to inherent data ambiguity and diversity of video content. Although deep learning has made a considerable progress in big data feature learning, they are viewed as deterministic models used in a “black-box” manner which does not have capabilities to represent inherent ambiguities with data. Since the possibility theory of fuzzy logic focuses on knowledge representation and reasoning under uncertainty, we intend to incorporate the concepts of fuzzy logic into deep learning framework. This paper presents a novel convolutional neuro-fuzzy network, which is an integration of convolutional neural networks in fuzzy logic domain to extract high-level emotion features from text, audio, and visual modalities. The feature sets extracted by fuzzy convolutional layers are compared with those of convolutional neural networks at the same level using t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. This paper demonstrates a multimodal emotion understanding framework with an adaptive neural fuzzy inference system that can generate new rules to classify emotions. For emotion understanding of movie clips, we concatenate audio, visual, and text features extracted using the proposed convolutional neuro-fuzzy network to train adaptive neural fuzzy inference system. In this paper, we go one step further to explain how deep learning arrives at a conclusion that can guide us to an interpretable AI. To identify which visual/text/audio aspects are important for emotion understanding, we use direct linear non-Gaussian additive model to explain the relevance in terms of causal relationships between features of deep hidden layers. The critical features extracted are input to the proposed multimodal framework to achieve higher accuracy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85068521737"

In the 2018 autonomous car crash in Arizona, the cause of the collision, inter alia, is argued to be a faulty system design, which needs to be backed up by a safety human operator to make the system fully safe. This issue highlights the complexity of assigning liability as the system involved several stakeholders responsible for designing the car, supply of hardware, programming, installing sensors and designing company policies for overseeing the driving process. It is to be probed, in like situations, whether the AI entity may be considered to have a ‘directing mind’ so as to address the determination of liability, which, depending on the situation, may attract vicarious liability or a breach of contract or criminal liability.Further, the issue of ascertaining liability parallelly impinges upon whether legal personhood may or may not be granted upon it. As there are no policy guidelines for dealing with AI in India, it may eventually attract legal and ethical issues with regard to its application. Therefore, the need to have a policy framework for businesses (while modelling and coding AI) and the government to meet the legal and ethical standards, can be addressed by primarily deciding upon the nature of entity an AI system is, and accordingly the liability may or may not be shifted from its creators to the AI system which exercises some degree of self-control. © 2019 by Advance Scientific Research.","2-s2.0-85077649114"

Therefore, the research suggests AI-based Anti-terror System module to predict terrorisms in advance, in a response to recognition of severity of the current terrorism state. Methods/Statistical analysis:AI-based Anti-terror System module consists of 6 components - Data Collection and Filtering Module, 1st Analysis of Data and Rule Generation Module, D/B, Monitoring Device, 2nd Analysis of Data and Rule Generation Module and Crime Response Module - more accurate and rapid terror responses is enabled through systematic process of collection, analysis, monitoring, response and feedback on terror-related risk data from each of the modules and devices. Findings: The proposal module collect relevant data to terror suspects with Big Data, analyze the realistically high terror-risk data, but filtered and stored, in two different phases, and generate and modify each rule based on extracted pattern of the analyzed data. Then, consistent monitoring on risky data of probable terrors is performed in concerns of the saved analysis and Crime Response Modules are triggered on the basis of the consequent results.Such a proposal module can improve the accuracy of related date, but save duration time in collection of particular data as it only collects relevant data to terror risks via Big Data Source and Filtering Module compared to the existing module. Furthermore, the operation manuals of 1st/2nd phase Data Analysis Modules systematically analyze the terror risks and probabilities, thus can minimize the risk of actual terrorisms in fields by triggering Terror Crime Response Modules rapidly by phases with an increased terror prediction accuracy. As Monitoring Device is additionally incorporated, constant supervision and feedbacks regarding certain risk data relevant to terrors are enabled - as a result, detailed analysis of high risk data is available. Improvements/Applications: Owing to connections among recent terror groups, terror risks are omnipresent throughout the world and prior data collection for time and patterns of terrors has become difficult, hence the AI-based Anti-terror System Module would allow minimization of consequent terror damages, enabling preliminary terror prevention and rapid crime responses. © BEIESP.","2-s2.0-85068846470"

For several applications in medicine, new methods from the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have already outperformed conventional prediction models. Due to their technical characteristics, these methods will present new ethical challenges to the intensivist. Results: In addition to the standards of data stewardship in medicine, the selection of datasets and algorithms to create AI prognostication models must involve extensive scrutiny to avoid biases and, consequently, injustice against individuals or groups of patients. Assessment of these models for compliance with the ethical principles of beneficence and non-maleficence should also include quantification of predictive uncertainty. Respect for patients’ autonomy during decision-making requires transparency of the data processing by AI models to explain the predictions derived from these models. Moreover, a system of continuous oversight can help to maintain public trust in this technology. Based on these considerations as well as recent guidelines, we propose a pathway to an ethical implementation of AI-based prognostication. It includes a checklist for new AI models that deals with medical and technical topics as well as patient- and system-centered issues. Conclusion: AI models for prognostication will become valuable tools in intensive care. However, they require technical refinement and a careful implementation according to the standards of medical ethics. © 2019, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85085986301"

Examples of such modularization include car navigation (a high-level path planning problem) and obstacle avoidance (a lower-level control problem), and decomposing playing policies in modern video games into strategic (""macro"") and tactical (""micro"") components. In real-time strategy (RTS) video games such as StarCraft, players face decision problems ranging from economic development to maneuvering units in combat situations. A popular strategy employed in building AI agents for complex games like StarCraft is to use this strategy of task decomposition to construct separate AI systems for each of these sub-problems, combining them to form a complete game-playing agent. Existing AI systems for such games often contain build-order planning systems that attempt to minimize makespans for constructing specific sets of units, which are typically decided by hand-coded human expert knowledge rules. Drawbacks of this approach include the human expert effort involved in constructing these rules, as well as a lack of online adaptability to unforeseen circumstances, which can lead to brittle behavior that can be exploited by more advanced opponents. In this paper we introduce a new robust build-order planning system for RTS games that automatically produces build-orders which optimize unit compositions toward strategic game concepts (such as total unit firepower), without the need for specific unit goals. When incorporated into an existing StarCraft AI agent in a real tournament setting, it outperformed the previous state-of-the-art planning system which relied on human expert knowledge rules for deciding unit compositions. © 2019 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85073099050"

We present use cases as well as several questions regarding the application of ML to the analysis of the vast amount of complex data that clinicians must interpret in the realm of continuous physiological monitoring. ML, especially employed in bidirectional conjunction with electronic health record data, has the potential to extract much more useful information out of this currently under-analyzed data source from a population level. As a data driven entity, ML is dependent on copious, high quality input data so that error can be introduced by low quality data sources. At present, while ML is being studied in hybrid formulations along with static expert systems for monitoring applications, it is not yet actively incorporated in the formal artificial learning sense of an algorithm constantly learning and updating its rules without external intervention. Finally, innovations in monitoring, including those supported by ML, will pose regulatory and medico-legal challenges, as well as questions regarding precisely how to incorporate these features into clinical care and medical education. Rigorous evaluation of ML techniques compared to traditional methods or other AI methods will be required to validate the algorithms developed with consideration of database limitations and potential learning errors. Demonstration of value on processes and outcomes will be necessary to support the use of ML as a feature in monitoring system development: Future research is needed to evaluate all AI based programs before clinical implementation in non-research settings. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","2-s2.0-85056318833"

Complex statistical algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) tools are being used to automate decision-making and are having a significant impact on individuals' rights and obligations. Controversies have emerged regarding the opaque nature of such schemes, the unintentional bias against and harm to under-represented populations, and the broader legal, social and ethical ramifications. State v Loomis, a recent case in the USA, well demonstrates how unrestrained and unchecked outsourcing of public power to machines may undermine human rights and the rule of law. With a close examination of the case, this article unpacks the issues of the 'legal black box' and the 'technical black box' to identify the risks posed by rampant 'algorithmization' of government functions to due process, equal protection and transparency. We further assess some important governance proposals and suggest ways for improving the accountability of AI-facilitated decisions. As AI systems are commonly employed in consequential settings across jurisdictions, technologically informed governance models are needed to locate optimal institutional designs that strike a balance between the benefits and costs of algorithmization. © 2019 The Author(s).

This co-adaption requires adaptive actions to react to unpredictable circumstances. One of the challenges is to deal with uncertainties, and consequently, decision making under uncertainty, which may arise because of the change in the environment, the unpredictable resources, etc. Human behavior does contribute to large amounts of uncertainty. This paper presents an approach for using a simulator as a means of feedback to a human's decision under uncertainty that can assist human in automated planning to generate cooperative and symbiotic strategy of human and the system to achieve given tasks. To validate the approach, this paper presents a customizable traffic simulator to measure the delays associated with passing vehicles through intersections. The simulator contains AI-based self-adaptive vehicles which can evaluate the quality of traffic at an intersection and change their driving behavior. The human operator from the outside of the system can manipulate the signaling time, the number of predicates per driving rule, number of rules per rule set, learning factor (adaption) etc. to overcome any unexpected traffic. This research proves that our simulator is more efficient than the individual human-operated and automated traffic system and makes a true cooperative traffic example. © 2019 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85082386850"

This is problematic not only for lack of transparency, but also for possible biases inherited by the algorithms from human prejudices and collection artifacts hidden in the training data, which may lead to unfair or wrong decisions. We focus on the urgent open challenge of how to construct meaningful explanations of opaque AI/ML systems, introducing the local-to-global framework for black box explanation, articulated along three lines: (i) the language for expressing explanations in terms of logic rules, with statistical and causal interpretation; (ii) the inference of local explanations for revealing the decision rationale for a specific case, by auditing the black box in the vicinity of the target instance; (iii), the bottom-up generalization of many local explanations into simple global ones, with algorithms that optimize for quality and comprehensibility. We argue that the local-first approach opens the door to a wide variety of alternative solutions along different dimensions: a variety of data sources (relational, text, images, etc.), a variety of learning problems (multi-label classification, regression, scoring, ranking), a variety of languages for expressing meaningful explanations, a variety of means to audit a black box. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Thus, a certain level of freedom to choose the best path to the goal is inherent in making AI robust and flexible enough. At the same time, however, the pervasive deployment of AI in our life, whether AI is autonomous or collaborating with humans, raises several ethical challenges. AI agents should be aware and follow appropriate ethical principles and should thus exhibit properties such as fairness or other virtues. These ethical principles should define the boundaries of AI's freedom and creativity. However, it is still a challenge to understand how to specify and reason with ethical boundaries in AI agents and how to combine them appropriately with subjective preferences and goal specifications. Some initial attempts employ either a data-driven example-based approach for both, or a symbolic rule-based approach for both. We envision a modular approach where any AI technique can be used for any of these essential ingredients in decision making or decision support systems, paired with a contextual approach to define their combination and relative weight. In a world where neither humans nor AI systems work in isolation, but are tightly interconnected, e.g., the Internet of Things, we also envision a compositional approach to building ethically bounded AI, where the ethical properties of each component can be fruitfully exploited to derive those of the overall system. In this paper we define and motivate the notion of ethically-bounded AI, we describe two concrete examples, and we outline some outstanding challenges. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

While it is often possible to approximate the input-output relations of deep neural networks with a few human-understandable rules, the discovery of the double descent phenomena suggests that such approximations do not accurately capture the mechanism by which deep neural networks work. Double descent indicates that deep neural networks typically operate by smoothly interpolating between data points rather than by extracting a few high level rules. As a result, neural networks trained on complex real world data are inherently hard to interpret and prone to failure if asked to extrapolate. To show how we might be able to trust AI despite these problems we introduce the concept of self-explaining AI. Self-explaining AIs are capable of providing a human-understandable explanation of each decision along with confidence levels for both the decision and explanation. Some difficulties with this approach along with possible solutions are sketched. Finally, we argue it is important that deep learning based systems include a “warning light” based on techniques from applicability domain analysis to warn the user if a model is asked to extrapolate outside its training distribution. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","2-s2.0-85088502282"

Unfortunately, the German Constitutional Court, the European Court of Justice, and the US Supreme Court are all struggling to develop convincing and clear-cut guidelines to direct these legislative and administrative considerations. This article attempts to offer such guidance: First, lawmakers need to implement regulatory provisions in order to maintain human accountability if AI-based law enforcement technologies are to be used. Secondly, AI law enforcement should be used, if and where possible, to overcome discriminatory traits in human policing that have plagued some jurisdictions for decades.

We consider a nine-stage workflow process informed by prior experiences developing AI applications (e.g., search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application diagnostics and bug reporting). We found that various Microsoft teams have united this workflow into preexisting, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes, providing insights about several essential engineering challenges that organizations may face in creating large-scale AI solutions for the marketplace. We collected some best practices from Microsoft teams to address these challenges. In addition, we have identified three aspects of the AI domain that make it fundamentally different from prior software application domains: 1) discovering, managing, and versioning the data needed for machine learning applications is much more complex and difficult than other types of software engineering, 2) model customization and model reuse require very different skills than are typically found in software teams, and 3) AI components are more difficult to handle as distinct modules than traditional software components-models may be 'entangled' in complex ways and experience non-monotonic error behavior.

The tuning method that we propose enables dealing with errors without the need to re-train the system. Instead of re-training a simple cascade of perceptron nodes is added to the legacy system. The added cascade modulates the AI legacy system's decisions. If applied repeatedly, the process results in a network of modulating rules “dressing up” and improving performance of existing AI systems.

Cloud computing, big data and Internet-of-Things (IoT) are distinctive cases of such an increase which demand novel approaches for data analytics in order to process and analyze huge volumes of data for security and business use. Cloud computing has been becoming popular for critical structure IT mainly due to cost savings and dynamic scalability. Current offerings, however, are not mature enough with respect to stringent security and resilience requirements. Mechanisms such as anomaly detection hybrid systems are required in order to protect against various challenges that include network based attacks, performance issues and operational anomalies. Such hybrid AI systems include Neural Networks, blackboard systems, belief (Bayesian) networks, case-based reasoning and rule-based systems and can be implemented in a variety of ways. Traffic in the cloud comes from multiple heterogeneous domains and changes rapidly due to the variety of operational characteristics of the tenants using the cloud and the elasticity of the provided services. The underlying detection mechanisms rely upon measurements drawn from multiple sources. However, the characteristics of the distribution of measurements within specific subspaces might be unknown. We argue in this paper that there is a need to cluster the observed data during normal network operation into multiple subspaces each one of them featuring specific local attributes, i.e. granules of information. Clustering is implemented by the inference engine of a model hybrid NN system. Several variations of the so-called value-difference metric (VDM) are investigated like local histograms and the Canberra distance for scalar attributes, the Jaccard distance for binary word attributes, rough sets as well as local histograms over an aggregate ordering distance and the Canberra measure for vectorial attributes. Low-dimensional subspace representations of each group of points (measurements) in the context of anomaly detection in critical cloud implementations is based upon VD metrics and can be either parametric or non-parametric. A novel application of a Self-Organizing-Feature Map (SOFM) of reduced/aggregate ordered sets of objects featuring VD metrics (as obtained from distributed network measurements) is proposed. Each node of the SOFM stands for a structured local distribution of such objects within the input space. The so-called Neighborhood-based Outlier Factor (NOOF) is defined for such reduced/aggregate ordered sets of objects as a value-difference metric of histogrammes. Measurements that do not belong to local distributions are detected as anomalies, i.e. outliers of the trained SOFM. Several methods of subspace clustering using Expectation-Maximization Gaussian Mixture Models (a parametric approach) as well as local data densities (a non-parametric approach) are outlined and compared against the proposed method using data that are obtained from our cloud testbed in emulated anomalous traffic conditions. The results—which are obtained from a model NN system—indicate that the proposed method performs well in comparison with conventional techniques. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","2-s2.0-85065059715"

AI has great potential to increase efficiency and accuracy throughout radiology, but it also carries inherent pitfalls and biases. Widespread use of AI-based intelligent and autonomous systems in radiology can increase the risk of systemic errors with high consequence and highlights complex ethical and societal issues. Currently, there is little experience using AI for patient care in diverse clinical settings. Extensive research is needed to understand how to best deploy AI in clinical practice. This statement highlights our consensus that ethical use of AI in radiology should promote well-being, minimize harm, and ensure that the benefits and harms are distributed among stakeholders in a just manner. We believe AI should respect human rights and freedoms, including dignity and privacy. It should be designed for maximum transparency and dependability. Ultimate responsibility and accountability for AI remains with its human designers and operators for the foreseeable future. The radiology community should start now to develop codes of ethics and practice for AI that promote any use that helps patients and the common good and should block use of radiology data and algorithms for financial gain without those two attributes. © 2019 The Author(s)","2-s2.0-85073960863"

This paper examines managers’ perceptions of the evolution of voice assistants and their potential effects on the marketing practice. Shopping-related voice assistants are likely to radically change the way consumers search and purchase products with severe impact on brands. However, the behavior of these AI-enabled machines represents a “black box” for brand owners. The study of the managers’ interpretation of a voice-enabled marketplace is critical as it may influence future marketing choices. The authors use an inductive theory construction process to study the phenomenon of voice commerce through the eyes of AI experts and voice-aware managers. A mixed-method approach paced three distinct data collection phases. First, systematic machine behavior observations (Amazon Alexa) unfolded the unique characteristics of voice shopping. Second, in-depth interviews with 30 executives drew the current brand owner’s challenges and opportunities in the context of voice commerce. Third, an expert survey with international managers (N = 62) revealed the expected impact of voice assistants on the shopping process. Findings show that managers consider voice assistants a disruptive technology assuming a central relational role in the consumer market. However, they often divergence in opinions across industry, function, and seniority level. Besides, managers’ familiarity with voice commerce is correlated to a higher optimism towards voice technologies (opportunity for brands) but also a greater sense of urgency (short-term focus) with implications for marketing strategy. This article offers support to brand owners explaining how voice assistants work and examining their effects on consumption. The authors discuss empirical results while providing managerial guidelines to create resilient and sustainable brands in the era of voice commerce. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","2-s2.0-85088741393"

Wargaming is used for several purposes, such as teaching strategic planning, practising the tasks associated with war, and analytic purposes (Burns et al., 2015). While wargaming is predominantly a human centric analytical activity, it is an area where artificial intelligence (AI) may play a useful role because of a computer's ability to play through a wider range of possible strategies. However, creating simulated AI participants for wargame scenarios is challenging because of the complexity and uncertainty in the environments in which they exist. The recent rise of automated behaviour discovery for agents in a variety of games traditionally dominated by humans offers a possible solution. Commercial real-time strategy (RTS) games provide an abstract simulation of a world where players aim to dominate and defeat other players by acquiring, using and managing resources, often including a mix of military, political, scientific and economic factors. As there is considerable overlap between the objectives found in RTS games to those that exist in military style wargames, RTS games are ideal platforms to conduct research and development in support of our AI-enabled wargaming research objectives. In this paper, we document our work on the use of evolutionary algorithms for automated behaviour discovery, where evolved behaviour trees are used as controllers for the blue team entities in the wargaming simulation. As behaviour trees are constructs formulated as a tree-type graph data structure, genetic programming (Koza, 1992), a technique developed specifically for the evolution of such structures was employed. In order to systematically evaluate the approach in terms of novel behaviour discovery, two test scenarios were designed to isolate particular features of land-based combat, inspired by terrain design patterns from computer games. A more complex scenario, involving multiple terrain constructs was also evaluated. A set of experiments were run on the developed scenarios to evolve a blue team against a static red team opponent. The red entities employed a reactive AI, with the simplicity of the red AI balanced by having a much greater number of red units in the scenario. Results from the experiments indicate that evolved behaviour tree controllers in a multi-agent scenario can be useful to identify a set of behaviours that exploit the properties of the scenario and lead to victory. In particular, we observed the 'expected' behaviour in the control scenarios: • Units learned to work together as a team, for example, armor units shielding artillery units. • Units in a relatively weak blue side learned to exploit a chokepoint in the terrain to defeat a superior red side. • Units learned to avoid dangerous sections of terrain, such as those protected by enemy snipers.

In addition to these regulatory toxicology studies, investigative toxicological study data for the selection of lead compound and candidate compound for clinical trials are directed to estimation by computational systems such as Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) and related expert systems. Furthermore, in the “Go” or “No-Go” decision of drug development, supportive utilization of a scientifically interpretable computational toxicology system is required for human safety evaluation. A pharmaceutical safety evaluator as a related toxicologist who is facing practical decision needs not only a data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that calls for the final consequence but also an explainable AI that can provide comprehensive information necessary for evaluation and can help with decision making. Through the explication and suggestion of information on the mechanism of toxic effects to safety assessment scientists, a subsidiary partnership system for risk assessment is ultimately to be a powerful tool that can indicate project-vector with data weight for the corresponding counterparts. To bridge the gaps between big data and knowledge, multi-dimensional thinking based on philosophical ontology theory is necessary for handling heterogeneous data for integration.

RESULTS: There is a rich history and tradition of evaluating AI in healthcare. While evaluators can learn from past efforts, and build on best practice evaluation frameworks and methodologies, questions remain about how to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of AI that dynamically harness vast amounts of genomic, biomarker, phenotype, electronic record, and care delivery data from across health systems. This paper first provides a historical perspective about the evaluation of AI in healthcare. It then examines key challenges of evaluating AI-enabled clinical decision support during design, development, selection, use, and ongoing surveillance. Practical aspects of evaluating AI in healthcare, including approaches to evaluation and indicators to monitor AI are also discussed. CONCLUSION: Commitment to rigorous initial and ongoing evaluation will be critical to ensuring the safe and effective integration of AI in complex sociotechnical settings.

The method operates on the principle of rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) [1, 2] and is capable in efficiently searching non-convex high dimension space. In this method, the entire search space is explored by the randomly generated point of intersections (PIs) which are connected to develop a tree-like path by expanding from start to end point, iteratively. These paths would meet the highway geometric guidelines and minimize associated cost. The potential sets of PIs are connected to generate the tangent sections, thus in developing an alignment. The alignment is checked for encroachment towards restricted areas and any violation leads to further refinement of the PI locations. Various researchers have extensively used artificial intelligence (AI) based heuristics algorithms for optimization of horizontal alignment. The proposed PPM is compared with one such algorithm, i.e. the ant algorithm (AA). Further, the suitability of the PPM in optimizing the horizontal alignment is reviewed. The efficiency of both the methods is verified through two case studies, one being a hypothetical and another using a real topographical map of a place in Gujarat, India. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","2-s2.0-85074658706"

Representing, learning, and reasoning with preferences is an important area of study both within computer science and across the social sciences. When we give our preferences to an AI system we expect the system to make decisions or recommendations that are consistent with our preferences but the decisions should also adhere to certain norms, guidelines, and ethical principles. Hence, when working with preferences it is necessary to understand and compute a metric (distance) between preferences - especially if we encode both the user preferences and ethical systems in the same formalism. In this paper we investigate the use of CP-nets as a formalism for representing orderings over actions for AI systems. We leverage a recently proposed metric for CP-nets and a neural network architecture, CPMETRIC, for computing this metric.

Many routine tasks continue to be executed without adequate assistance from tools that would be in reach of the current technical capabilities of AI. Using the example of taking meeting minutes, the paper presents some intermediate results of the capabilities and problems of currently available natural language processing systems to automatically record meeting minutes. It further highlights the potential of optimizing the allocation of tasks between humans and machines to take the particular strengths and weaknesses of both into account. In order to combine the functionality of supervised and unsupervised machine learning with rule-based AI or traditionally programmed software components, the capabilities of AI-based system actors need to be incorporated into the system design process as early as possible. Treating AI as actors enables a more effective allocation of tasks upfront, which makes it easier to come up with a hybrid workplace scenario where AI can support humans in doing their work more efficiently.

The solution relies on process engineering and plant knowledge combined with AI tools like ontology and rule-based reasoning. The aim is to enhance the basis for rapid and intelligent decision-making and increase human performance when abnormal situations occur. The solution is based on ""Multilevel Flow Modeling"" (MFM), which is a modeling language that builds on a systematic representation of relations between objectives and functions of plant equipment in a means-ends structure. The aim of MFM in this context is to develop models that allows for reasoning about causes and consequences of events, or upsets in process plants, such as oil and gas production facilities. A key feature of MFM is its compatibility with human cognition and results of MFM reasoning can therefore be communicated to operators in an intuitive way. In their daily life, control room operators are presented with process variables through a SCADA system and alarms to notify them that something is not right. Their task is to maintain the production in in the plant and avoid unnecessary disturbances and shut-downs, for which they often rely on the information they receive through the systems as well as their experience. When abnormal events occur, operators often need to respond fast, in order to avoid plant upsets, however, there are no solutions to support them with situation analysis and root cause identification. The MFM based solution samples plant data and develops ""failure trees"" in real-time that are presented to panel operators in a simplistic and logical way. The solution has been developed in an industry-academia collaboration, in close collaboration with two operators. Initial online testing has been done on pilot plant basis, whereas the piloting on offshore fields is currently ongoing. The modeling work is done in close collaboration with engineers and operators familiar with the targeted plant facilities, in order to secure that all relevant operational aspects are adequately covered. In parallel, a UX development path is ongoing and is part of the integrated test program. The novelty of the decision support solution as well as knowledge about how it impacts control room operators in their daily work is discussed. The learnings and experience from offshore pilot testing are also presented. © 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers","2-s2.0-85086057083"

However, all physiological manifestations of CAD either appear late in the time-curve or are non-specific surrogate markers. With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), there is new hope using multi-modal non-invasive sensing and analysis. In this paper, we combine domain knowledge with AI based data analysis to propose a novel two-stage approach that effectively incorporates multiple CAD markers in various non-invasive cardiovascular signals for an improved diagnosis system. At first stage, a hierarchical rule-engine identifies the high cardiac risk population using patient demography and medical history, who are further analysed at the second stage using numeric features from various cardiovascular signals.

Although artificially intelligent (AI) systems have been making great strides in this field, particularly with the development of deep learning architectures that carry surface-level statistical methods to greater levels of sophistication, these systems are yet incapable of deep semantic analysis, reliable translation, and generating rich answers to open-ended questions. I consider how the process may be facilitated from our side, first, by altering some of our existing language conventions (which may occur naturally) if we are to proceed with statistical approaches, and secondly, by considering possibilities in using a formalised artificial language as an auxiliary medium, as it may avoid many of the inherent ambiguities and irregularities that make natural language difficult to process using rule-based methods. As current systems have been predominantly English-based, I argue that a formal auxiliary language would not only be a simpler and more reliable medium for computer processing, but may also offer a more neutral, easy-to-learn lingua franca for uniting people from different linguistic backgrounds with none necessarily having the upper hand. © 2019 The authors.","2-s2.0-85078433283"

Indeed, although AI allows us to address and solve very difficult and complicated problems, AI-based tools act as a black box and, usually, do not explain how/why/when a specific decision has been taken. Among AI models, Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems (FRBSs) are recognized world-wide as transparent and interpretable tools: they can provide explanations in terms of linguistic rules. Moreover, FRBSs may achieve accuracy comparable to those achieved by less transparent models, such as neural networks and statistical models. In this work, we introduce SK-MOEFS (acronym of SciKit-Multi Objective Evolutionary Fuzzy System), a new Python library that allows the user to easily and quickly design FRBSs, employing Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms. Indeed, a set of FRBSs, characterized by different trade-offs between their accuracy and their explainability, can be generated by SK-MOEFS.

These methods are based on the economic structural equations themselves, ignoring the interactions between economic subjects, and the hypothesis of subject homogeneity has no reference in the real world. On contrast, this paper proposes a multi-agent simulation model, from the microscopic point of view. In such simulation, agents interact with each other, and the decisions are made by agent-embedded AI systems, the Q-network. Therefore, there is no need to elaborate the behavioral rule for each agent, or manually set up too many assumptions. This paper assumes that the simulated market operates in a hypothetical way, in which there are two types of economic entities, namely, banks and enterprises. Banks and enterprises lending behaviors lead to a symbiotic relationship between the banks and the enterprises, while business-to-business transactions make the enterprises symbiotically compete with each other. In the experiment, the observed behavior of each agent can be reasonably explained. Agents endogenously generate intelligent behavioral patterns compatible with the environment. Therefore, this AI-based method can replace the artificially designated decision-making strategy in simulations of market, thus facilitating related economic researches. © 2019 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85078160479"

It is designed to test software, which are complex in nature and it is difficult to compute test oracle for them against a given set of inputs. Metamorphic testing approach tests the software with the help of metamorphic relations that guide the tester to check if the observed output can be produced after applying a certain input. Since its first appearance, a lot of research has been done to check its effectiveness on different complex families of software applications like search engines, compilers, artificial intelligence (AI) and so on. Artificial intelligence has gained immense attention due to its successfully application in many of the computer science and even other domains like medical science, social science, economic, and so on. AI-based applications are quite complex in nature as compared to other conventional software applications and because of that they are hard to test. We have selected specifically testing of AI-based applications for this research study. Although all the researchers claim to propose the best set of metamorphic relations to test AI-based applications but that still needs to be verified. In this study, we have performed a critical review supported by rigorous set of parameters that we have prepared after thorough literature survey. The survey shows that researchers have applied metamorphic testing on applications that are either based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) or Machine Learning (ML). Our analysis has helped us identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approaches. Research still needs to be done to design a generalized set of metamorphic rules that can test a family of AI applications rather than just one. The findings are supported by strong arguments and justified with logical reasoning. The identified problem domains can be targeted by the researchers in future to further enhance the capabilities of metamorphic testing and its range of applications. © 2020 Science and Information Organization.","2-s2.0-85085277768"

Fortunately, machine and deep learning techniques of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are proving to be effective in this scenario. The main objective of this tutorial is to understand how AI-based techniques can help in fault detection and localization to take such services closer to the performance and availability of the traditional networks. A case study, based on our work in this area, has been included for a better understanding of the concepts. © 2019","2-s2.0-85073944593"

Since then, the efforts have been made to make AI systems understand the rules of arbitrary computer games without any human help. This paper will introduce a new model based on neural networks and genetic algorithm concepts which has the potential to replace behavior tree model currently used by game developers for making AI systems. This model introduces the possibility for AI systems to be trained in the game instead of creating complex nested if-else tree to determine the next move. This adaptive learning approach for AI systems could potentially lead to development of more powerful and engaging AI systems known as Non playable characters in gaming industry.

However, the vast portion of data used to train AI systems is sensitive information. Hence, any vulnerability has a potentially disastrous impact on privacy aspects and security issues. Nevertheless, the increased demands for high-quality AI from governments and companies require the utilization of big data in the systems. Several studies have highlighted the threats of big data on different platforms and the countermeasures to reduce the risks caused by attacks. In this paper, we provide an overview of the existing threats which violate privacy aspects and security issues inflicted by big data as a primary driving force within the AI/ML workflow. We define an adversarial model to investigate the attacks. Additionally, we analyze and summarize the defense strategies and countermeasures of these attacks. Furthermore, due to the impact of AI systems in the market and the vast majority of business sectors, we also investigate Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) that are actively involved in providing guidelines to protect the privacy and ensure the security of big data and AI systems.

The rapidly rising volume of data along with increasing client expectations inspired many researchers to develop new computerized techniques to automate building design process. These techniques can be broken down into two broad categories: automated computer-aided design tools (e.g., development of building information modeling or BIM) and measuring or modeling client expectations (e.g., use of facial expressions to find psychological expectations of the client). Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have made possible new approaches to the automation of design. This represents a shift from a focus on client-designer or designer-technology relationships to a more intelligent and independent client-technology communication. In this paper, a novel AI system called intelligent designer is proposed to understand (or learn) the client's need and expectations and generate valid designs. The design environment (i.e., the interaction between the client and the design) is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and a mathematical framework is provided for making design decisions in situations where new designs are partly random (as they are influenced by the client's feedback) and partly under the control of the computer (as they are influenced by the regulations, standards, and guidelines). The approach is demonstrated using a window design experiment. © 2019","2-s2.0-85062300547"

However, placing the Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a virtual world get making these environments both more interactive and more believable. One of the most ambitious goals of the AI is to create virtual worlds in which a big number of virtual characters or humans being interacted and behave in an autonomous way. For this purpose, placing embodied intelligence characters in a virtual world offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the AI concept. This paper introduces a Virtual Island developed in an innovative way based on fuzzy rules at the user interaction mechanism. We have used fuzzy tactics to create AI-based animals having various behavior types from an eagles’ perspective which called ‘Flight Simulation’. The simulation utilizes an eagle flying over the airspace of the Island of Chios. The AI on the ground is triggered by other animals when they enter a radius area with a certain speed defined in the software. It then decides how to behave according to health, behavior type and confidence level. Also, there is non-AI sparrow herd placed over the island to make user understand how fast he is and give the user sense of speed what can be called as an in-project feature. Consequently, the used Fuzzy Tactics have been tested in realized Unity 3D simulation. The results of the study have proven that the virtual environment consisting AI-based animals has a good performance in terms of animal-user interactions and provided satisfactory results in run time. © 2019","2-s2.0-85067381625"

A section of the reactor core resembles a symmetrical grid; long fuel assemblies are inserted there, some of them new, some of them partly spent. Rods of “burnable poisons” dangle above, ready to be inserted into the core, in order to stop the reactor. Traditionally, manual design was made by shuffling positions in the grid heuristically, but AI enabled to automatically generate families of candidate configurations, under safety constraints, as well as in order to optimize combustion, with longer cycles of operation between shutdown periods, thus delaying the end-of-cycle point (except in France, where shutdown is on an annual basis, and Canada, where individual fuel assemblies are replaced, with no need for shutdown for rearranging the entire batch). Rule-based expert systems, the first being FUELCON, were succeeded by projects combining neural and rule-based processing (a symbolic-to-neural compilation of rules we did not implement), and later on, genetic algorithms in FUELGEN. In the literature, one also comes across the application of fuzzy techniques, tabu search, cellular automata and simulated annealing, as well as particle swarms. Safety regulations require simulating the results using a parameter prediction tool; this is done using either nodal algorithms, or neural processing. © 2019 by the author.

But human laws and norms are complex and culturally varied systems; in many cases agents will have to learn the rules. This requires autonomous agents to have models of how human rule systems work so that they can make reliable predictions about rules. In this paper we contribute to the building of such models by analyzing an overlooked distinction between important rules and what we call silly rules -rules with no discernible direct impact on welfare. We show that silly rules render a normative system both more robust and more adaptable in response to shocks to perceived stability. They make normativity more legible for humans, and can increase legibility for AI systems as well. For AI systems to integrate into human normative systems, we suggest, it may be important for them to have models that include representations of silly rules. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Two university hospitals. Participants: Hemiplegic adults with elbow flexor spasticity due to acquired brain injury (N=34). Intervention: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Twenty-eight rehabilitation doctors and occupational therapists examined MAS of elbow flexors in 34 subjects with hemiplegia due to acquired brain injury while the MAS score and biomechanical data (ie, joint motion and resistance) were collected. Nine biomechanical parameters that quantify spastic response described by the joint motion and resistance were calculated. An AI algorithm (or artificial neural network) was trained to predict the MAS score from the parameters. Afterwards, the contribution of each parameter for determining MAS scores was analyzed. Results: The trained AI agreed with the human raters for the majority (82.2%, Cohen's kappa=0.743) of data. The MAS scores chosen by the AI and human raters showed a strong correlation (correlation coefficient=0.825). Each biomechanical parameter contributed differently to the different MAS scores. Overall, angle of catch, maximum stretching speed, and maximum resistance were the most relevant parameters that affected the AI decision. Conclusions: AI can successfully learn clinical assessment of spasticity with good agreement with multiple human raters. In addition, we could analyze which factors of spastic response are considered important by the human raters in assessing spasticity by observing how AI learns the expert decision. It should be noted that few data were collected for MAS3; the results and analysis related to MAS3 therefore have limited supporting evidence. © 2019 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.

It is argued that, despite the enormous achievements of AI systems, it would be a serious mistake to suppose that such systems, unaided by human intervention, are as yet any nearer to providing robust solutions to the problems posed by Keynesian uncertainty. Under the radically uncertain conditions, human decision-making (for all its problems) has proved relatively robust, while decision making relying solely on deterministic rules or probabilistic models is bound to be brittle. AI remains dependent on techniques that are seldom seen in human decision-making, including assumptions of fully enumerable spaces of future possibilities, which are rigorously computed over, and extensively searched. Discussion of alternative models of human decision making under uncertainty follows, suggesting a future research agenda in this area of common interest to AI and economics. © Author(s) 2016.","2-s2.0-84962270851"

It was observed that the ANN (94.7 %) can predict body types more accurately than the discriminant analysis (83.5 %). The ANN is a more effective method than a statistical analysis because the ANN requires fewer input measurement variables than the discriminant analysis to predict body types.

Our results show that commercial systems mainly avoid answering, while rule-based chatbots show a variety of behaviours and often deflect.

While Dinky and Dirty challenges have been extensively explored in ML theory, the Dynamic challenge has been a persistent problem in ML applications (when the statistical distribution of training data differs from that of test data). The most recent Deceptive challenge is a malicious distribution shift between training and test data that amplifies the effects of the Dynamic challenge to the complete breakdown of the ML algorithms. Using the MNIST dataset as a simple calibration example, we explore the following two questions: (1) What geometric and statistical characteristics of data distribution can be exploited by an adversary with a given magnitude of the attack? (2) What counter-measures can be used to protect the constructed decision rule (at the cost of somewhat decreased performance) against malicious distribution shift within a given magnitude of the attack?

In particular, HetNets have attracted great interest from academia and industry in deploying more effective solutions based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, e.g., machine learning, bio-inspired algorithms, fuzzy neural network, and so on, because AI techniques can naturally handle the problems of large-scale complex systems, such as HetNets towards more intelligent and automatic-evolving ones.

An efficient electronic circuit unswervingly affects the maneuver of the whole system. Different tools are required to unravel different types of engineering tribulations. Improving the efficiency, accuracy and low power consumption in an electronic circuit is always been a bottle neck problem. So the need of circuit miniaturization is always there. It saves a lot of time and power while switching of gates and reduces the wiring-crises. Therefore to trounce with this problem we have proposed an artificial intelligence (AI) based approach that makes use of Rough Set Theory for its implementation. Theory of rough set has been proposed by Z Pawlak in the year 1982. Rough set theory is a new mathematical tool which deals with uncertainty and vagueness. Decisions can be generated using rough set theory by reducing the unwanted and superfluous data. We have condensed the number of gates without upsetting the productivity of the given circuit. This paper proposes an approach using artificial intelligence technique with the help of rough set theory which basically lessens the number of gates in the circuit, based on decision rules. © 2013 IEEE.","2-s2.0-84910022177"

For this, one conventional rule-based and four AI-based algorithms were developed, including artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy logic (FL), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), for operating the surface openings of the double skin and the heating system. A numerical computer simulation method incorporating the matrix laboratory (MATLAB) and the transient systems simulation (TRNSYS) software was used for the comparative performance tests. The analysis results revealed that advanced thermal-environment comfort and stability can be provided by the AI-based algorithms. In particular, the FL and ANFIS algorithms were superior to the ANN algorithm in terms of providing better thermal conditions. The ANN-based algorithm, however, proved its potential to be the most energy-efficient and stable strategy among the four AI-based algorithms. It can be concluded that the optimal algorithm can be differently determined according to the major focus of the strategy. If comfortable thermal condition is the principal interest, then the FL or ANFIS algorithm could be the proper solution, and if energy saving for space heating and system operation stability is the main concerns, then the ANN-based algorithm may be applicable. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These have undergone considerable development over the last 30 years to ensure they are appropriate for the development of both complex hardware, software and service systems and the current best practices are described in the recently published ISO 16355 for QFD.

In a view of nuclear power plants (NPP), it seems that AI technology applies to NPPs at the last because NPPs are required the most stringent level of regulatory guideline for safety. To overcome it, AI technology should be applied incrementally into the NPPs rather than all at once. According to the unintended shutdown records during startup and shutdown operation from 1997 to 2017 in Korea, it is reported that human errors accounts for 40% of the total. This is because operators feel heavy burden to monitor hundreds of parameters for a long time of operating time. Also, there are lots of startup and shutdown operating history that can be used for correcting the data from the NPP simulator. Therefore, this work proposes a framework to develop AI automatic operating system for startup and shutdown operations of NPPs. Operating procedures of startup and shutdown operations are categorized. In addition, AI technologies will be introduced to find out the most suitable learning algorithm. It is expected that economic loss from human error during startup and shutdown operation will be reduced as AI system developed. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","2-s2.0-85050396116"

Seventeen experts provided 42 propositions from ten different perspectives as input for the ERT. A full-day ERT deliberated communalities and relationships among these unseens and provided suggestions on (i) what the major unseens are; (ii) how rebound effects of digital transitioning may become the subject of overarching research; and (iii) what unseens should become subjects of transdisciplinary theory and practice processes for developing socially robust orientations. With respect to the latter, the experts suggested that the ""ownership, economic value, use and access of data"" and, related to this, algorithmic decision-making call for transdisciplinary processes that may provide guidelines for key stakeholder groups on how the responsible use of digital data can be developed. A cluster-based content analysis of the propositions, the discussion and inputs of the ERT, and a theoretical analysis of major changes to levels of human systems and the human-environment relationship resulted in the following greater picture: The digital transition calls for redefining economy, labor, democracy, and humanity. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based machines may take over major domains of human labor, reorganize supply chains, induce platform economics, and reshape the participation of economic actors in the value chain. (Digital) Knowledge and data supplement capital, labor, and natural resources as major economic variables. Digital data and technologies lead to a post-fuel industry (post-) capitalism. Traditional democratic processes can be (intentionally or unintentionally) altered by digital technologies. The unseens in this field call for special attention, research and management. Related to the conditions of ontogenetic and phylogenetic development (humanity), the ubiquitous, global, increasingly AI-shaped interlinkage of almost every human personal, social, and economic activity and the exposure to indirect, digital, artificial, fragmented, electronically mediated data affect behavioral, cognitive, psycho-neuro-endocrinological processes on the level of the individual and thus social relations (of groups and families) and culture, and thereby, the essential quality and character of the human being (i.e., humanity). The findings suggest a need for a new field of research, i.e., focusing on sustainable digital societies and environments, in which the identification, analysis, and management of vulnerabilities and unseens emerging in the sociotechnical digital transition play an important role. © 2018 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85048560543"

While AI has advanced significantly over the past years, with its ability surpassing humans in several fields, the one thing that it still lacks is social awareness i.e. have the social skills of a human, a sense of what is appropriate and what isn't and make decisions based on that. These are highly subjective and there is no single set of rules to determine them. With the use of AI increasing at such a high rate that AI has become a part of people's everyday lives it is absolutely necessary for AI systems to know what is socially acceptable.

In the past four decades, many investigations have been conducted on this process, aiming to better understand its nature and improve the surface quality of the products as well as extending tool life. To achieve these goals, it is necessary to form a general descriptive reference model of the milling process using experimental data, thermomechanical analysis, statistical or artificial intelligence (AI) models. Moreover, increasing demands for more efficient milling processes, qualified surface finishing, and modeling techniques have propelled the development of more effective modeling methods and approaches. In this paper, an extensive literature survey of the state-of-the-art modeling techniques of milling processes will be carried out, more specifically of recent advances and applications of AI-based modeling techniques. The comparative study of the available methods as well as the suitability of each method for corresponding types of experiments will be presented. In addition, the weaknesses of each method as well as open research challenges will be presented. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison of recent developments in the field will be a guideline for choosing the most suitable modeling technique for this process regarding its goals, conditions, and specifications. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85027944397"

For these reasons, ways for combining declarative paradigms, such as Answer Set Programming (ASP), with traditional ones have been significantly studied in the recent years; there are however relevant contexts, in which this road is unexplored, such as development of real-time games. In such a setting, the strict requirements on reaction times, the presence of computer-human interactivity and a generally increased impedance between the two development paradigms make the task nontrivial. In this work we illustrate how to embed rule-based reasoning modules into the well-known Unity game development engine. To this end, we present an extension of EmbASP, a framework to ease the integration of declarative formalisms with generic applications.

The proposed structure consists of five layer feed-forward network which is trained using sequential learning method. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), a recently developed novel method for the training of the single hidden layer feed forward neural networks (SLFNs) is used to initialize the training algorithm with a small chunk of training data. The membership function for each rule is determined using heuristics based methods and the consequent parameters of the Tagaki-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) type fuzzy inference are then determined in an online manner using the recursive least square method. The performance of the proposed technique in terms of the training time, training accuracy for tracking a reference trajectory is evaluated and is compared with the adaptive neuro-fuzzy based controller and other existing faster training algorithms such as ELM. The robustness of the proposed scheme is tested under DC motor parameters variations such as armature resistance, viscous friction and moment of inertia for all implemented controllers.

This goal implies a sufficiently in-depth molecular diagnosis of the personal cancer of a given patient. A sufficiently robust and extended dynamic modeling will suggest rational combinations of the abovementioned oncoprotein inhibitors. The work toward new selective drugs, in the field of medicinal chemistry, is very intensive. Rational associations of selective drug inhibitors will become progressively a more realistic goal within the next 3-5 years. Toward the possibility of an implementation in standard oncologic structures of technologically sufficiently advanced countries, new (legal) rules probably will have to be established through a consensus process, at the level of both diagnostic and therapeutic behaviors.

Nonetheless, the acceptance of AI-based diagnoses by the physicians is hampered by the black-box approach implemented by most performing systems, which do not clearly state the classification rules adopted. Methods: In this framework we propose a classification method based on a Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) approach, which allows for the automatic identification of the presence of the disease, and concurrently, provides the explicit classification model used by the system. Results: The proposed approach has been evaluated on the publicly available HandPD dataset, which contains handwriting samples drawn by Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls. We show that our approach compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods, and more importantly, allows the physician to identify an explicit model relevant for the diagnosis based on the most informative subset of features. Conclusion: The obtained results suggest that the proposed approach is particularly appealing in that, starting from the explicit model, it allows the physicians to derive a set of guidelines for defining novel testing protocols and intervention strategies. © 2019 by the authors.","2-s2.0-85063767849"

These distributed agents are the first phase of an overall plan to create a smarter network defense system through the collection and analysis of network signatures generated by real security threats. The central database to which the agents report warehouses and analyzes the meta-information collected by the interconnected agents. The agents can then utilize both instantaneous and historical data by integrating rules derived from the data collection and analysis process into intrusion prevention policies. The final result will be a modular and scalable network defense system that should be more responsive and adaptable to imminent threats. © 2016 IEEE.","2-s2.0-84980048143"

This suggests that it might be feasible to build AI systems that use similar criteria for generating their own concepts, and could thus learn similar concepts as humans do.

Against this background, the aim of the paper is twofold. First, the intent is to show how often today's discussion on the legal status(es) of AI systems leads to different kinds of misunderstanding that regard both the legal personhood of AI robots and their status as accountable agents establishing rights and obligations in contracts and business law. Second, the paper claims that whether or not the legal status of AI systems as accountable agents in civil-as opposed to criminal-law may make sense is an empirical issue, which should not be 'politicized'. Rather, a pragmatic approach seems preferable, as shown by methods of competitive federalism and legal experimentation. In the light of the classical distinction between primary rules and secondary rules of the law, examples of competitive federalism and legal experimentation aim to show how the secondary rules of the law can help us understanding what kind of primary rules we may wish for our AI robots.

Speed and change in speed are sent as input to Neuro-Fuzzy Controller and it winds up noticeably fit for real-time electromechanical drives. The complete simulation model for indirect vector control of induction motor including the suggested NFC is developed. Induction motor assumes an imperative part in the field of electric drives. Without genuine controlling of the speed, it is difficult to accomplish required errand for specific application. AC motors are solid, less cost, reliable, and maintenance free. In light of absence of capacity of regular control strategies like PID and PI controllers to work in a broad range of operations, AI-based controllers are extensively utilized as a part of the industry like Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic, and Neuro-Fuzzy controller. The principle issue with the typical fuzzy-based controllers is that the parameters related with the membership functions and the rules depend predominantly on instinct of the specialists, fuzzy logic cannot naturally get the rules utilized for settling on the decision, however, great at clarifying the decision. To overcome from this issue, Neuro-Fuzzy Controller [ability to learn without anyone else alongside decision-making] is recommended.

In this paper, four different game-playing agents that embody different playing styles are defined and used to analyze Ticket to Ride. Different playing styles are shown to be effective depending on the map and rule variation, and also depending on how many players play the game. The performance profiles of the different agents can be used to characterize maps and identify the most similar maps in the space of playstyles. Further analysis of the automatically played games reveal which cities on the map are most desirable, and that the relative attractiveness of cities is remarkably consistent across numbers of players. Finally, the automated analysis also reveals two classes of failures states, where the agents find states which are not covered by the game rules; this is akin to finding bugs in the rules.

Sage advice, such as “if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all” and principles articulated in Carnegie's classic How to Win Friends and Influence People, offer trusted rules-of-thumb for how people can successfully deal with each other. However, alternative philosophies for dealing with people have also emerged. The success of an AI system is likewise contingent on its ability to win friends and influence people. In this paper, we study how AI systems should be designed to win friends and influence people in repeated games with cheap talk (RGCTs). We create several algorithms for playing RGCTs by combining existing behavioral strategies (what the AI does) with signaling strategies (what the AI says) derived from several competing philosophies. Via user study, we evaluate these algorithms in four RGCTs. Our results suggest sufficient properties for AIs to win friends and influence people in RGCTs.

These biases threaten to overshadow AI’s technological gains and potential benefits. While legal and computer science scholars have analyzed many sources of bias, including the unexamined assumptions of its oftenhomogenous creators, flawed algorithms, and incomplete datasets, the role of the law itself has been largely ignored. Yet just as code and culture play significant roles in how AI agents learn about and act in the world, so too do the laws that govern them. This Article is the first to examine perhaps the most powerful law impacting AI bias: copyright. Artificial intelligence often learns to ""think"" by reading, viewing, and listening to copies of human works. This Article first explores the problem of bias through the lens of copyright doctrine, looking at how the law's exclusion of access to certain copyrighted source materials may create or promote biased AI systems. Copyright law limits bias mitigation techniques, such as testing AI through reverse engineering, algorithmic accountability processes, and competing to convert customers. The rules of copyright law also privilege access to certain works over others, encouraging AI creators to use easily available, legally low-risk sources of data for teaching AI, even when those data are demonstrably biased. Second, it examines how a different part of copyright law-the fair use doctrine-has traditionally been used to address similar concerns in other technological fields, and asks whether it is equally capable of addressing them in the field of AI bias. The Article ultimately concludes that it is, in large part because the normative values embedded within traditional fair use ultimately align with the goals of mitigating AI bias and, quite literally, creating fairer AI systems. © 2018, University of Washington School of Law.

The recent proposal for general game-playing robots extends this to AI systems that play games in the real world. Execution monitoring becomes a necessity when moving from a virtual to a physical environment, because in reality actions may not be executed properly and (human) opponents may make illegal game moves. We develop a formal framework for execution monitoring by which an action theory that provides an axiomatic description of a game is automatically embedded in a meta-game for a robotic player - called the arbiter - whose role is to monitor and correct failed actions. This allows for the seamless encoding of recovery behaviours within a meta-game, enabling a robot to recover from these unexpected events.","2-s2.0-84949812532"

Due to a lack of knowledge to support functional reasoning from the behaviors of constituent basic mechanisms to the whole functional behaviors of complex mechanisms, the AI-based type synthesis of compound mechanisms is still a hard challenge. In this article, a grammar-based synthesis approach is proposed for carrying out the type synthesis of complex mechanisms. The grammar-based synthesis rules, in which the functional requirements and the topological connections among functional members are included, are defined with the aid of nine kinds of common functional requirements that are primarily exhibited by complex mechanical systems. Through assigning a function as well as topological connections to each element in the graphic carrier according to the grammar-based synthesis rules, the type synthesis process for complex mechanisms is carried out automatically. Since the divergence creative design technique is applied, this system can efficiently expand the synthesis solution space of complex mechanisms, and more innovative design schemes including generalized mechanisms can be figured out. For extremely complex mechanisms, though dividing the design problem into several smaller parts, and carrying out grammar-based synthesis process to each smaller part, respectively, then combing the generated schemes from each smaller part together, the function-based synthesis for extremely complex mechanisms can also be solved.

In particular, we argue that trust plays a central role for relationships in the healthcare domain, and the introduction of healthcare AI can potentially have significant impacts on those relations of trust. We contend that healthcare AI systems ought to be treated as assistive technologies that go beyond the usual functions of medical devices. As a result, we need to rethink regulation of healthcare AI systems to ensure they advance relevant values.

The PSS controller acts on damping the electromechanical modes of oscillations not only through a wide range of operating conditions but also in presence of different disturbances.

Inspired by the latest breakthroughs of AI and its power to address large-scale and complex difficulties, the network community has begun to consider shifting the NTC paradigm from legacy rule-based to novel AI-based. As an applied inter-discipline, design and implementation are important. Although there have been some preliminary explorations along this frontier, they are either limited by only envisioning the prospects, or too scattered to provide high-level insight into a general methodology. To this end, we start with the domain knowledge relationships of AI and NTC, summarizing a baseline workflow toward deep reinforcement learning, which will be the dominant method for the AI-NTC paradigm. On top of that, we argue that AI-NTC training and running must be carried out in online environments in closed-loop fashion for the purpose of putting ti into practice. A series of challenges and opportunities are discussed from a realistic viewpoint, and a set of new architecture and mechanism to enable the online and closed-loop AI-NTC paradigm are proposed.

In the past, AI systems were mainly to support physicians. They were 'rule-based' and specifically designed to assist in diagnosis or to recommend drugs to be prescribed to patients. Current clinical medicine is not performed by a physician acting alone, but through cooperation between staff with various occupations. Kimura Information Technology Co., Ltd. (KIT, Japan) has built a system named 'AI-Q' that works on the Japanese version of IBM's Watson and with which it is possible to build arbitrary problem solving systems. AI-Q was made to serve a variety of purposes, and a system for pharmacists has been built for drug information. In this paper, we illustrate how practical applications of AI can be designed for use by medical staff other than physicians and discuss how the system can be extended to other fields. We converted an AI system previously used to support pharmacists into one for certified clinical engineers (CCE). The purpose of this paper is to give the background of the system for CCE and to evaluate it. © 2018 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85060297808"

Design/methodology/approach: The existing literature was carefully reviewed to address the state of the arts in decision support systems (DSS), the shortcomings of pure simulation-based and pure AI-based DSS. A conceptual example is illustrated to show the integrated application of AI, simulation and database components of the proposed DSS framework. Findings: Recent DSS studies have revealed the limitations of pure simulation-based and pure AI-based DSS. A new DSS framework is required in manufacturing to address these limitations, taking into account the problems of flowing items. Research limitations/implications: The theoretical DSS framework is proposed using simple rules and equations. This implies that it is not complex for software development and implementation. Practical data are not presented in this paper. A real DSS will be developed using the proposed theoretical framework and realistic results will be presented in the near future. Originality/value: The proposed theoretical framework reveals how the integrated components of DSS can work together in manufacturing in order to determine the stable flow of items in a specific production period. Especially, the integrated performance of case-based reasoning (CBR) and DES is conceptually illustrated. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","2-s2.0-85028776813"

Furthermore, most of the remaining concerns are minor and are faced by human caregivers as well.

The dynamic reasoning is one of essential mechanisms to mimic the human decision-making process. Since the timing difference between internal rule firing and externally incoming fact is critical to conclude the final decision. Unfortunately conventional AI systems cannot deal with such problems. In order to overcome this limitation, we have proposed the dynamic rule structure that consists of the condition and action as well as the inferencing time. Then we also have developed the dynamic inference algorithm that can handle the time-based rules.

In this paper we describe and critically assess the different ways AI systems are evaluated, and the role of components and techniques in these systems. We first focus on the traditional task-oriented evaluation approach. We identify three kinds of evaluation: human discrimination, problem benchmarks and peer confrontation. We describe some of the limitations of the many evaluation schemes and competitions in these three categories, and follow the progression of some of these tests. We then focus on a less customary (and challenging) ability-oriented evaluation approach, where a system is characterised by its (cognitive) abilities, rather than by the tasks it is designed to solve. We discuss several possibilities: the adaptation of cognitive tests used for humans and animals, the development of tests derived from algorithmic information theory or more integrated approaches under the perspective of universal psychometrics. We analyse some evaluation tests from AI that are better positioned for an ability-oriented evaluation and discuss how their problems and limitations can possibly be addressed with some of the tools and ideas that appear within the paper. Finally, we enumerate a series of lessons learnt and generic guidelines to be used when an AI evaluation scheme is under consideration. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","2-s2.0-84982270121"

Nevertheless, AI applications have not been consolidated as standard solutions in the industry, and most common applications of AI still are case studies and pilot projects. In this work, an analysis of survey conducted on a broad group of professionals related to several E&P operations and service companies is presented. This survey captures the level of AI knowledge in the industry, the most common application areas, and the expectations of the users from AI-based solutions. It also includes a literature review of technical papers related to AI applications and trends in the market and in research and development. The survey helped to verify that (a) data mining and neural networks are by far the most popular AI technologies used in the industry; (b) approximately 50% respondents declared they were somehow engaged in applying workflow automation, automatic process control, rule-based case reasoning, data mining, proxy models, and virtual environments; (c) production is the area most affected by the applications of AI technologies; (d) the perceived level of available literature and public knowledge of IA technologies is generally low; and (e) although availability of information is generally low, it is not perceived equally among different roles. This work aims to be a guide for personnel responsible for production and asset management on how AI-based applications can add more value and improve their decision making. The results of the survey offer a guideline on which tools to consider for each particular oil and gas challenge.

These mechanisms for defining goals and guiding optimization run into practical and conceptual difficulty when there are independent, multi-dimensional objectives that need to be pursued simultaneously and cannot be reduced to each other. Ethicists have proved several impossibility theorems that stem from this origin; those results appear to show that there is no way of formally specifying what it means for an outcome to be good for a population without violating strong human ethical intuitions (in such cases, the objective function is a social welfare function). We argue that this is a practical problem for any machine learning system (such as medical decision support systems or autonomous weapons) or rigidly rule-based bureaucracy that will make high stakes decisions about human lives: such systems should not use objective functions in the strict mathematical sense. We explore the alternative of using uncertain objectives, represented for instance as partially ordered preferences, or as probability distributions over total orders. We show that previously known impossibility theorems can be transformed into uncertainty theorems in both of those settings, and prove lower bounds on how much uncertainty is implied by the impossibility results. We close by proposing two conjectures about the relationship between uncertainty in objectives and severe unintended consequences from AI systems. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

This allows humans to adapt easily to novel situations where AI fails catastrophically due to a lack of situation-specific rules and generalization capabilities. Commonsense knowledge also provides background information that enables humans to successfully operate in social situations where such knowledge is typically assumed. Since commonsense consists of information that humans take for granted, gathering it is an extremely difficult task. Previous versions of SenticNet were focused on collecting this kind of knowledge for sentiment analysis but they were heavily limited by their inability to generalize.

Its metabolites have structural, metabolic, and regulatory roles within the body. Humans can endogenously produce small amounts of choline via the hepatic phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase pathway. However, the nutrient must be consumed exogenously to prevent signs of deficiency. The Adequate Intake (AI) for choline was calculated at a time when dietary intakes across the populationwere unknown for the nutrient. Unlike the traditional National Academy of Medicine approach of calculating an AI based on observed or experimentally determined approximations or estimates of intake by a group (or groups) of healthy individuals, calculation of the AI for choline was informed in part by a depletionrepletion study in adultmen who, upon becoming deficient, developed signs of liver damage. The AI for other gender and life-stage groups was calculated based on standard reference weights, except for infants 0 to 6 months, whose AI reflects the observedmean intake from consuming human breast milk. Recent analyses indicate that large portions of the population (ie, approximately 90% of Americans), including most pregnant and lactating women, are well below the AI for choline. Moreover, the food patterns recommended by the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans are currently insufficient to meet the AI for choline in most age-sex groups. An individual's requirement for choline is dependent on common genetic variants in genes required for choline, folate, and 1-carbon metabolism, potentially increasing more than one-third of the population's susceptibly to organ dysfunction. The American Medical Association and American Academy of Pediatrics have both recently reaffirmed the importance of choline during pregnancy and lactation. Newand emerging evidence suggests that maternal choline intake during pregnancy, and possibly lactation, has lasting beneficial neurocognitive effects on the offspring.

With the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommending expansion of dietary information for pregnant women, and the inclusion of recommendations for infants and toddlers 0 to 2 years, better communication of the role that choline plays, particularly in the area of neurocognitive development, is critical.

While it is one possible scenario, it is probably the least likely path to appearance of dangerous AI. In this work, we survey, classify and analyze a number of circumstances, which might lead to arrival of malicious AI. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically classify types of pathways leading to malevolent AI.

Typically, in real-time applications, large amounts of disparate data must be processed, learned from, and actionable intelligence provided in terms of recognition of evolving activities. Applications like Rapid Situational Awareness (RSA) used for support of critical systems (e.g., Battlefield Management and Control) require critical analytical assessment and decision support by automatically processing massive and increasingly amounts of data to provide recognition of evolving events, alerts, and providing actionable intelligence to operators and analysts [2 and 4]. Herein we prescribe potential methods and strategies for continuously adapting, life-long machine learning within a self-learning and self-evaluation environment to enhance real-time/near real-time support for mission critical systems. We describe the notion of continuous adaptation, which requires an augmented paradigm for enhancing traditional probabilistic machine learning. Specifically, systems which must more aptly operate in harsh/soft unknown environments without the need of a priori statistically trained neural networks nor fully developed learning rules for situations that have never been thought of yet. This leads to a hypothesis requiring new machine learning processes, in which abductive learning is applied. We utilize varying unsupervised/self-supervised learning techniques, statistical/fuzzy models for entities, relationships, and descriptor extraction. We also involve topic and group discovery and abductive inference algorithms. to expand system aperture in order to envision what outlying factors could have also caused current observations. Once extended plausible explanations are found, we will show how a system uses the afore mentioned implements to potentially learn about new or modified causal relationships and extend, reinterpret, or create new situational driven memories.

Our logical language builds on the existing general Game Description Language (GDL) and extends it by a standard modality for linear time along with two dual connectives to express preferences when combining strategies. The semantics of the language is provided by a standard state-transition model. As such, problems that require reasoning about games can be solved by the standard methods for reasoning about actions and change. We also endow the language with a specific semantics by which strategy formulas are understood as move recommendations for a player. To illustrate how our formalism supports automated reasoning about strategies, we demonstrate two example methods of implementation: first, we formalise the semantic interpretation of our language in conjunction with game rules and strategy rules in the Situation Calculus; second, we show how the reasoning problem can be solved with Answer Set Programming. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","2-s2.0-84938212066"

First of all, we introduce Neo4J graph databases and, specifically, MultiWordNet-Extended, a graph representing linguistic knowledge. After this first overview, we show how information included in graphs can be used in speech recognition grammars to automatically extend a generic rule structure. This can be the case of linguistic elements, such as synonyms, hypernyms, meronyms and phonological neighbours, which are semantically or structurally related to each other in our mental lexicon. In all the AI based approaches depending on a training process using large and representative corpora, the probability to correctly predict the creativity a speaker can perform in using language and posing questions is lower than expected. Trying to capture most of the possible words and expressions a speaker could use is extremely necessary, but even an empirical, finite collection of cases could not be enough. For this reason, the use of our tool appears as an appealing solution, capable of including many pieces of information. In addition, we used the proposed tool to develop a spoken dialogue system for museums and the preliminary results are shown and discussed in this paper. © IWCS 2017.

Ethical aspects are among important extra-functional properties, that cover the whole life cycle with different stages from design, development, deployment/production to use of cyber physical systems. One of the ethical challenges involved is the question of identifying the responsibilities of each stakeholder associated with the development and use of a cyber-physical system. This challenge is made even more pressing by the introduction of autonomous increasingly intelligent systems that can perform functionalities without human intervention, because of the lack of experience, best practices and policies for such technology. In this article, we provide a framework for responsibility attribution based on the amount of autonomy and automation involved in AI based cyber-physical systems. Our approach enables traceability of anomalous behaviors back to the responsible agents, be they human or software, allowing us to identify and separate the 'responsibility' of the decision-making software from human responsibility. This provides us with a framework to accommodate the ethical 'responsibility' of the software for AI based cyber-physical systems that will be deployed in the future, underscoring the role of ethics as an important extra-functional property. Finally, this systematic approach makes apparent the need for rigorous communication protocols between different actors associated with the development and operation of cyber-physical systems that further identifies the ethical challenges involved in the form of group responsibilities. © 2015 IEEE.","2-s2.0-84962148615"

Traditional design guidelines for AI models focus essentially on accuracy maximization, but recent work has shown that economically irrational and socially unacceptable scenarios of discrimination and unfairness are likely to arise unless these issues are explicitly addressed. This undesirable behavior has several possible sources, such as biased datasets used for training that may not be detected in black-box models. After pointing out connections between such bias of AI and the problem of induction, we focus on Popper's contributions after Hume's, which offer a logical theory of preferences. An AI model can be preferred over others on purely rational grounds after one or more attempts at refutation based on accuracy and fairness. Inspired by such epistemological principles, this paper proposes a structured approach to mitigate discrimination and unfairness caused by bias in AI systems. In the proposed computational framework, models are selected and enhanced after attempts at refutation. To illustrate our discussion, we focus on hiring decision scenarios where an AI system filters in which job applicants should go to the interview phase. © 2018 ACM.","2-s2.0-85061028426"

One of the most crucial parts of AAL development is the integration of the different developed components to a functional cohesive platform. Integration strategies are many and varied catering to different system needs. The USEFIL AAL system was conceived as a platform utilizing low cost off-the-shelf technology and providing an independent and healthy lifestyle to elderly people. This platform like several AAL platforms reached its system integration stage consisting of relatively few components. In that context technological hurdles have been resolved in the development process of each component. For that reason in the present work the focus is on relatively simple but crucial “observations from the field” taken during the USEFIL AAL platform’s integration effort. The resulting guidelines for integration of AAL platforms are: A) Managerial clarity: Clearly defined roles both cross and within teams, robust avenues of interpersonal communication, detailed and flexible fiscal planning. B) Testing diligence: No assumptions should be made about the robustness of components or the triviality of tests. Component interconnection may lead to unexpected loss of functionality. C) Iterative functional testing: In the case of AAL systems with complex AI components the introduction of additional infrastructure may lead to significant differentiation in functionality a thing that needs to be tested and corrected if detected.

Healthcare providers are expected to use best practices described in clinical practice guidelines, which typically consist of a long series of complex rules. For heart failure management, the relevant guidelines are nearly 80 pages long. Due to their complexity, the guidelines are often difficult to fully comply with, which can result in suboptimal medical practices. In this paper, we describe a heart failure treatment adviser system that automates the entire set of rules in the guidelines for heart failure management. The system is based on answer set programming, a form of declarative programming suited for simulating human-style reasoning. Given a patient's information, the system is able to generate a set of guideline-compliant recommendations. We conducted a pilot study of the system on 21 real and 10 simulated patients with heart failure. The results show that the system can give treatment recommendations compliant with the guidelines. Out of 187 total recommendations made by the system, 176 were agreed upon by the expert cardiologists. Also, the system missed eight valid recommendations. The reason for the missed and discordant recommendations seems to be insufficient information, differing style, experience, and knowledge of experts in decision-making that were not captured in the system at this time. The system can serve as a point-of-care tool for clinics. Also, it can be used as an educational tool for training physicians and an assessment tool to measure the quality metrics of heart failure care of an institution. © 2018 IEEE.","2-s2.0-85057380517"

The problem with the current situation regarding ethics and AI is the weaknesses of ML and KR when used separately. ML will “learn” ethical behaviour as it is observed and may therefore disagree with human morals. On the other hand, KR is too rigid and can only process scenarios that have been predefined. This paper proposes a solution to the question posed by Rossi (2016) “How to combine bottom-up learning approaches with top-down rule-based approaches in defining ethical principles for AI systems?” This system focuses on potential unethical behaviors that are caused by human nature instead of ethical dilemmas caused by technology insufficiency in the wartime scenarios. Our solution is an architecture that combines a classifier to identify targets in wartime scenarios and a rules-based system in the form of ontologies to guide an AI agent’s behaviour in the given circumstance.

This paper attempts to solve this problem by proposing a number of aesthetic feature representations and feeding them into Artificial Neural Networks. Specifically, 22 global shape features are presented to describe a given handwritten Chinese character from different aspects according to classical calligraphic rules, and a new 10-dimensional feature vector is introduced to represent the component layout information using sparse coding. Moreover, a Chinese Handwriting Aesthetic Evaluation Database (CHAED) is also built by collecting 1000 Chinese handwriting images with diverse aesthetic qualities and inviting 33 subjects to evaluate the aesthetic quality for each calligraphic image. Finally, back propagation neural networks are constructed with the concatenation of the proposed features as input and then trained on our CHAED database for the aesthetic evaluation of Chinese calligraphy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AI system provides a comparable performance with human evaluation. Through our experiments, we also compare the importance of each individual feature and reveal the relationship between our aesthetic features and the aesthetic perceptions of human beings.","2-s2.0-84949811371"

Experimental determination of the adsorption capacity of diverse chemicals onto carbon is both time and resource intensive, and development of computational approaches has widely been advocated. In this study, artificial intelligence (AI)-based ten different qualitative and quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models (MLPN, RBFN, PNN/GRNN, CCN, SVM, GEP, GMDH, SDT, DTF, DTB) were established for the prediction of the adsorption capacity of structurally diverse chemicals to activated carbon following the OECD guidelines. Structural diversity of the chemicals and nonlinear dependence in the data were evaluated using the Tanimoto similarity index and Brock-Dechert-Scheinkman statistics. The generalization and prediction abilities of the constructed models were established through rigorous internal and external validation procedures performed employing a wide series of statistical checks. In complete dataset, the qualitative models rendered classification accuracies between 97.04 and 99.93 %, while the quantitative models yielded correlation (R2) values of 0.877–0.977 between the measured and the predicted endpoint values. The quantitative prediction accuracies for the higher molecular weight (MW) compounds (class 4) were relatively better than those for the low MW compounds. Both in the qualitative and quantitative models, the Polarizability was the most influential descriptor. Structural alerts responsible for the extreme adsorption behavior of the compounds were identified. Higher number of carbon and presence of higher halogens in a molecule rendered higher binding affinity. Proposed QSPR models performed well and outperformed the previous reports. A relatively better performance of the ensemble learning models (DTF, DTB) may be attributed to the strengths of the bagging and boosting algorithms which enhance the predictive accuracies. The proposed AI models can be useful tools in screening the chemicals for their binding affinities toward carbon for their safe management. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2-s2.0-84947474672"

This prototype is based on ASPEN, the Automated Scheduling and Planning Environment. This Artificial Intelligence (AI) based planning and scheduling system will automatically generate a command sequence that will execute within resource constraints and satisfy flight rules. An automated planning and scheduling system encodes rover design knowledge and uses search and reasoning techniques to automatically generate low-level command sequences while respecting rover operability constraints, science and engineering preferences, environmental predictions, and also adhering to hard temporal constraints. This prototype planning system has been field-tested using the Rocky-7 rover at JPL, and will be field-tested on more complex rovers to prove its effectiveness before transferring the technology to flight operations for an upcoming NASA mission. Enabling goal-driven commanding of planetary rovers greatly reduces the requirements for highly skilled rover engineering personnel. This in turn greatly reduces mission operations costs. In addition, goal-driven commanding permits a faster response to changes in rover state (e.g., faults) or science discoveries by removing the time consuming manual sequence validation process, allowing rapid ""what-if"" analyses, and thus reducing overall cycle times.","2-s2.0-0035558029"

In this chapter we discuss the difficulties of distinguishing between the two. First, a suitable characterization of profit that distinguishes between trading gains and market gains is required. Secondly, one needs to be able to characterize trading ""strategies"". To achieve this, we introduce the notion of a genotype-phenotype map to finance, where the genotype is associated with the information set and associated decision rules that lead to a given set of trading decisions for a given trader, while the phenotype is described by the set of observable trading decisions themselves. In AI based systems, such as agent-based markets, a strategy is implemented algorithmically and so the genotype is explicitly known. In real markets however, the genotypic trading strategy of one trader is hidden from the rest. The phenotype however, is, in principle, observable. A microscopic description at the level of the set of individual trades, however, is not sufficient to understand or characterize the strategies at a more macroscopic and intuitive one. By introducing a set of coarse grained variables that can be used to classify strategy types, we show how these variables can then be data mined to understand what differs between an intelligent and a lucky strategy. We show that these variables can be used to distinguish between different strategy types and can be further used to infer the presence of learning and adaptation in the market.

Experience-Based (EB) Identification and Control is explored with the objective of achieving more human-like processes for 'intelligent' computing Agents. The notion of experience is being successfully addressed via a novel concept for applying Reinforcement Learning (RL), called HLLA - Higher Level Learning Algorithm. The key idea is to re-purpose the RL method (to a ""higher level"") such that instead of creating an optimal controller for a given task, an already achieved collection of such solutions for a variety of related contexts is provided (as an experience repository), and HLLA creates a strategy for optimally selecting a solution from the repository. The selection process is triggered by the Agent becoming aware that a change in context has occurred, followed by the Agent seeking information about what changed - a process here called context discernment - and finally, by selection. Typically, context discernment entails a form of system identification (SID); substantial enhancement of SID is also achieved via the EB methods.

Heuristic information obtained from the PN model is used to dramatically reduce the search space. This heuristic is derived from a new concept, the resource cost reachability matrix, which builds on the properties of B-nets proposed in Part I.

Hence, prediction of protein structures from protein sequences using computer programs is an important step to unveil proteins' three dimensional conformation and functions. As a result, prediction of protein structures has profound theoretical and practical influence over biological study. In this talk, we will show how to use machine learning methods with various advanced encoding schemes and classifiers improve the accuracy of protein structure prediction.

The speed controllers based on (1) feed-forward neural network, (2) neuro-fuzzy network, and (3) self-organizing Takagi-Sugeno (TS) rule based model are designed. A comparative analysis of the drive behaviour with these three types of AI based speed controllers is performed. In addition, a comparison is made with respect to the drive performance obtained with a conventional optimized PI controller. A detailed simulation study of a number of transients indicates that the best performance, in terms of accuracy and computational complexity, is offered by the self-organizing Takagi-Sugeno controller.

Rules in the CTSHIV knowledge base encode knowledge about sequence mutations in the HIV genome that have been found to result in drug resistance to the HIV virus. Rules are applied to the actual HIV sequences of the virus strains infecting the specific patient undergoing clinical treatment to infer current drug resistance. A rule-directed search through mutation sequence space identifies nearby drug-resistant mutant strains that might arise. The possible combination drug-treatment regimens currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are considered and ranked by their estimated ability to avoid identified current and nearby drug-resistant mutants. The highest-ranked treatments are recommended to the attending physician. The result is more precise treatment of individual HIV patients and a decreased tendency to select for drug-resistant genes in the global HIV gene pool. Initial results from a small human clinical trial are encouraging, and further clinical trials are planned. From an AI viewpoint, the case study demonstrates the extensibility of knowledge-based systems because it illustrates how existing encoded knowledge can be used to support new knowledge-based applications that were unanticipated when the original knowledge was encoded. of productive years of life lost aggregated over all age groups. HIV is estimated to infect 40 to 50 million persons worldwide (CDC 1997). The high rate of HIV viral mutation both makes development of a vaccine difficult and results in rapid positive selection for drug-resistant mutant strains. Recent multidrug combination therapies are encouraging but in most cases ultimately fail because of the development of drug resistance (O'Brian et al. 1996). A general theory of HIV drug resistance still is not in hand, but a number of specific sequence mutations in the HIV genome have been described in the scientific literature and associated with increased resistance to certain drugs. In this article, we describe an AI system (CTSHIV) intended to improve the clinical treatment of individual HIV patients by identifying drug resistance in advance and avoiding it in treatment. The improvement is accomplished by first identifying drug-resistant HIV mutant strains that already exist in the patient, or can be selected positively for, by certain treatments and then recommending a customized treatment strategy designed to avoid selection of such mutants. The result is more precise treatment of individual HIV patients and a decreased tendency to select for drug-resistant genes in the global HIV gene pool.

Competition-based evaluation, using common challenge problems, is one of the major methods for comparing AI systems employing robotic embodiment. Competitions unfortunately tend to influence the creation of specific solutions that exploit particular rules rather than the broad and robust techniques that are hoped for, however, and physical embodiment in the real world also creates difficulties in control and repeatability. In this paper we discuss the positive and negative influences of competitions as a means of evaluating AI systems, and present recent work designed to improve such evaluations. We describe how improved control and repeatability can be achieved with mixed reality applications for challenge problems, and how competitions themselves can encourage breadth and robustness, using our rules for the FIRA HuroCup as an example. © 2009, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.","2-s2.0-70350554054"

However, blood sugar levels of most diabetic patients are not well controlled. For a patient with chronic disease, treatment efficiency could be influenced by the disease, remedy, and mental condition, in addition to his/her physiological status. Therefore, there is a great deal of difficulty in establishing a guideline to decide the reasonable dosage for a particular patient. To address this difficulty, this study, via team cooperation with the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Taichung Hospital, has designed an artificial intelligence (AI) system. This AI system may provide a real-time monitoring of patient's physical condition and adjust the insulin dosage from AI system to facilitate the monitoring, caring, and management of patients. Furthermore, abnormal condition may be detected earlier and then emergency treatment may be provided in time to prevent the occurrence of any unfortunate events caused by negligence. With this system, data of 4 patients was partitioned into training data set (3/2) and test data set (1/3). Training data set was entered into ANM system for an analysis of learning stage to build a prediction model for insulin dosage. Upon the completion, the test data set was tested with this prediction model for the accuracy of dosage control by bioartificial pancreas. Results showed that ANM system may effectively predict the occurrence of problems related to insulin dosage of bioartificial pancreas, with a satisfactory accuracy. © 2012 IEEE.","2-s2.0-84864208478"

The objective of the considered refinement technique is to overcome particular invalidities revealed by the application of a case oriented validation technology. So it has to be set into the context of ""learning by examples"". Classical AI approaches are often not useful for a system refinement that is really up to an appropriate modeling of the domain knowledge. Furthermore, they often lead to a knowledge base which is difficult to read and to interpret, because it is too far from a ""natural way"" to express domain knowledge. The refinement process here is characterized by (1) using human expertise that also is a product of the validation technique and (2) keeping as much as possible of the original human made knowledge base.

Researchers are usually thinking about the organization of the brain when considering network configurations and algorithms. But the knowledge about the brain's overall operation is so limited that there is little to guide those who would emulate it. Hence, at present time biologists, psychologists, computer scientists, physicists and mathematicians are working all over the world to learn more and more about the brain. Interests in neural network differ according to profession like neurobiologists and psychologists try to understanding brain. Engineers and physicists use it as tool to recognize patterns in noisy data, business analysts and engineers use to model data, computer scientists and mathematicians viewed as a computing machines that may be taught rather than programmed and artificial intelligentsia, cognitive scientists and philosophers use as sub-symbolic processing (reasoning with patterns, not symbols), etc. A conventional computer will never operate as brain does, but it can be used to simulate or model human thought. In 1955, Herbert Simon and Allen Newell announced that they had invented a thinking machine. Their program, the logic theorist, dealt with problems of proving theories based on assumptions it was given. Simon and Newell later developed the general problem solver, which served as the basis of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Simon and Newell believed that the main task of AI was figuring out the nature of the symbols and rules that the mind uses. For many years AI engineers have used the ""top-down"" approach to create intelligent machinery. The top-down approach starts with the highest level of complexity, in this case thought, and breaks it down into smaller pieces to work with. A procedure is followed step by step. AI engineers write very complex computer programs to solve problems. Another approach to the modelling of brain functioning starts with the lowest level, the single neuron. This could be referred to as a bottom-up approach to modelling intelligence. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2-s2.0-48249099745"

To automate this tedious process, an artificial intelligence (AI) guided system was developed and examined. Methods: The AI system can automatically accomplish the optimization process based on prior knowledge operated by several fuzzy inference systems (FIS). Prior knowledge, which was collected from human planners during their routine trial-and-error process of inverse planning, has first to be ""translated"" to a set of ""if-then rules"" for driving the FISs. To minimize subjective error which could be costly during this knowledge acquisition process, it is necessary to find a quantitative method to automatically accomplish this task. A well-developed machine learning technique, based on an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), was introduced in this study. Based on this approach, prior knowledge of a fuzzy inference system can be quickly collected from observation data (clinically used constraints). The learning capability and the accuracy of such a system were analyzed by generating multiple FIS from data collected from an AI system with known settings and rules. Results: Multiple analyses showed good agreements of FIS and ANFIS according to rules (error of the output values of ANFIS based on the training data from FIS of 7.77 ± 0.02%) and membership functions (3.9%), thus suggesting that the ""behavior"" of an FIS can be propagated to another, based on this process. The initial experimental results on a clinical case showed that ANFIS is an effective way to build FIS from practical data, and analysis of ANFIS and FIS with clinical cases showed good planning results provided by ANFIS. OAR volumes encompassed by characteristic percentages of isodoses were reduced by a mean of between 0 and 28%. Conclusion: The study demonstrated a feasible way to automatically perform parameter optimization of inverse treatment planning under guidance of prior knowledge without human intervention other than providing a set of constraints that have proven clinically useful in a given setting. © 2009 Stieler et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","2-s2.0-70449512086"

The electric demand growth requires the increase of the installed capacity to meet the consumption. Another alternative is the better use of installed capacity. Demand side management (DSM) has been increasingly adopted by utilities as a subroutine for huge investments and as a method for optimization or resources use. DSM is the ability of a GRID to continue normal operation despite unplanned causalities to the operating equipment, known as contingencies. The DSM is essentially concerned with predicting the vulnerability of the current state (normal) to a set of postulated next contingencies. The system operates in three different states normal, emergency and restorative states. Recently Artificial Intelligence (AI) based Expert System procedures have been adopted for the GRID management problem. An Expert System (ES) one branch of AI is a computer application that solves complicated problems that would otherwise require extensive human expertise. To do so, it simulates the human reasoning process by applying specific knowledge and inferences. The system is not case oriented. It is composed of a main module, which based upon set of rules, selects one of many possible solutions to perform DSM.

As an application example, we show how FCM can be employed to solve the challenging problem of recognizing cryovolcanism from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Cassini data. The fuzzy cognitive map is constructed using what is currently known about cryovolcanism on Titan and relies on geological mapping performed by planetary scientists to interpret different locales as cryovolcanic in nature. The system is not conceived to replace the human scientific interpretation, but to enhance the scientists' ability to deal with large amounts of data, and it is a first step in designing AI systems that will be able, in the future, to autonomously make decisions in situations where human analysis and interpretation is not readily available or could not be sufficiently timely. The proposed FCM is tested on Cassini radar data to show the effectiveness of the system in reaching conclusions put forward by human experts and published in the literature. Four tests are performed using the Ta SAR image (October 2004 fly-by). Two regions (i.e. Ganesa Macula and the lobate high backscattering region East of Ganesa) are interpreted by the designed FCM as exhibiting cryovolcanism in agreement with the initial interpretation of the regions by Stofan et al. (2006). Importantly, the proposed FCM is shown to be flexible and adaptive as new data and knowledge are acquired during the course of exploration. Subsequently, the FCM has been modified to include topographic information derived from SAR stereo data. With this additional information, the map concludes that Ganesa Macula is not a cryovolcanic region. In conclusion, the FCM methodology is shown to be a critical and powerful component of future autonomous robotic spacecraft (e.g., orbiter(s), balloon(s), surface/lake lander(s), rover(s)) that will be deployed for the exploration of Titan. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

These factors have dependencies in a large set of heterogeneous information, which is often owned by different entities and data sources. All this information needs to be integrated to allow seamless use and consistent management, and after consolidation it can be reliably and quickly, communicated. This paper deals with the design of a Knowledge Based Expert System (KBES) able to provide an 'on-line failures recognition and assessment' of tightly interconnected, technological infrastructures. This in turn contributes to a machine- readable, integrated, conceptual model of the whole system. In particular the aim of this paper is to present an intelligent software tool, using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques which allows the execution of an alarm analysis, through the remote sensing activity of complex plants. The AI component is based on CLIPS (C-Language Integrated Production System) which is a tool that offers a complete environment for developing a rule-based expert system. The AI component allows identification of the primary faults of the system, discriminating these former from other offshoot alarms. In other words, this tool shows which alarms are directly connected to primary faults and which alarms are consequential effects of the primary ones. The core of the software is an algorithm which uses a knowledge ontology and a set of alarm propagation rules which are both based on the Multilevel Flow Modelling (MFM) paradigm. The proposed algorithm has been tested integrating it with EPANET and by simulating some fault scenarios and analyzing the results.©ASCE 2009.","2-s2.0-69949101617"

In this case, if our theories about the world are too certain, we would be unable to predict facts and relations with lower likelihood. And I will demonstrate that if we admit that our knowledge is approximate, despite the incompleteness we will be able to predict facts and relations that are of lower likelihood through Pattern Matching.

The survey helped to verify that (a) data mining and neural networks are by far the most popular AI technologies used in the industry; (b) approximately 50% of respondents declared they were somehow engaged in applying workflow automation, automatic process control, rule-based case reasoning, data mining, proxy models, and virtual environments; (c) production is the area most impacted by the applications of AI technologies; (d) the perceived level of available literature and public knowledge of AI technologies is generally low; and (e) although availability of information is generally low, it is not perceived equally among different roles.

Although the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based trading algorithms has been an active research area over the last decade, there have been relatively few applications to intraday foreign exchange-the trading frequency at which technical analysis is most commonly used. Previous academic studies have concentrated on testing popular trading rules in isolation or have used a genetic algorithm approach to construct new rules in an attempt to make positive out-of-sample profits after transaction costs. In this paper we consider strategies which use a collection of popular technical indicators as input and seek a profitable trading rule defined in terms of them. We consider two popular computational learning approaches, reinforcement learning and genetic programming (GP), and compare them to a pair of simpler methods: the exact solution of an appropriate Markov decision problem and a simple heuristic. We find that although all methods are able to generate significant in-sample and out-of-sample profits when transaction costs are zero, the genetic algorithm approach is superior for nonzero transaction costs, although none of the methods produce significant profits at realistic transaction costs. We also find that there is a substantial danger of overfitting if in-simple learning is not constrained.","2-s2.0-0035391018"

These factors have dependencies in a large set of heterogeneous information, which is often owned by different entities and data sources. All this information needs to be integrated to allow seamless use and consistent management, and after consolidation it can be reliably and quickly, communicated. This paper deals with the design of a Knowledge Based Expert System (KBES) able to provide an 'on-line failures recognition and assessment' of tightly interconnected, technological infrastructures. This in turn contributes to a machine-readable, integrated, conceptual model of the whole system. In particular the aim of this paper is to present an intelligent software tool, using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques which allows the execution of an alarm analysis, through the remote sensing activity of complex plants. The AI component is based on CLIPS (C-Language Integrated Production System) which is a tool that offers a complete environment for developing a rule-based expert system. The AI component allows identification of the primary faults of the system, discriminating these former from other offshoot alarms. In other words, this tool shows which alarms are directly connected to primary faults and which alarms are consequential effects of the primary ones. The core of the software is an algorithm which uses a knowledge ontology and a set of alarm propagation rules which are both based on the Multilevel Flow Modelling (MFM) paradigm. The proposed algorithm has been tested integrating it with EPANET and by simulating some fault scenarios and analyzing the results. Copyright 2009 ASCE.","2-s2.0-77957721122"

This is done by means of a computer-aided system intended to guide the designer in the selection of optimum production parameters according to general product requirements proper of the first design stages. The proposed system makes use of a number of artificial intelligence (AI) tools, namely: fuzzy inference, relational databases and rule-based decision making to reach an optimum solution. A pilot application developed in Matlab is presented to illustrate the system application on a real mechanical part used as a case study. In the article it is shown how the proposed model may be useful for presenting feasible RM alternatives for parts and products not originally intended for additive manufacture. It also indicates when no RM alternatives are suitable for the given tasks, thus indicating those areas of knowledge which are necessary to expand in order to have at disposal comprehensive and reliable info on RM to compete with conventional processes. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-77951128369"

A subclass of PNs, Buffer nets or B-nets is obtained by the systematic synthesis of PN models from FMS formulations. Scheduling is performed as heuristic search in the reachability tree, which is guided by a new heuristic function that exploits PN information. This heuristic is derived from a new concept, the Resource Cost Reachability (RCR) matrix which builds on the properties of B-nets. To mitigate the complexity problem, a hybrid search algorithm is proposed. The algorithm combines dispatching rules based on analysis information provided by the PN simulation with a modified stage-search algorithm. Experimental results are provided and indicate the effectiveness of the approach and the potential of PN-based heuristic search for FMS scheduling. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Using semantic systems in building these tools (along with database and/or AI-based systems) allows for more efficient representation of tacit knowledge. Such systems are based on a common ontology of the subject domain, where entities (such as actors, processes and products) are interlinked to represent the essence of the knowledge in the domain. The paper presents a taxonomy for building construction. The taxonomy includes 6000 concepts and was developed using OWL. It maps to existing classification systems to assure better coverage. The taxonomy is the first attempt to present building construction knowledge in a semantic way. It also represents the foundations developing ontology-based corporate memory systems. To demonstrate the role and contribution of the proposed taxonomy a prototypical ontology for building construction was developed. Furthermore, a framework for agent-based system for supporting semi-automatic generation of reports such as lessons learned, work forms, and meeting agendas. Such agents allow organizations to capture and document its knowledge (in a taxonomy-complaint format) and to feed back post-project knowledge into new ones through access to lessons learned and through pre-defined meeting agendas. Access to these reports is done through semantic search according to the proposed taxonomy. Future research will develop a formal ontology and further develop the framework and implement it in actual organizations. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-33744526706"

However, the same speed estimator ANN was also successfully used in a drive with a 2.2 kW motor. Speed estimators using feed-forward multilayer and recursive artificial neural networks (ANNs) are also compared. In addition to an ANN-based estimator, the second drive contains a simple fuzzy-logic-based system with a minimal rule-base, which improves the low-speed performance.

This paper presents a design of a Decision Support System (DSS) that facilitates ""on-demand"" knowledge generation by utilizing results of simulation runs of a suitably calibrated and validated hydraulic model of an existing aged WDN corresponding to emergent or even hypothetical but likely scenarios. The DSS augments the capability of a conventional expert system by integrating together the hydraulic modelling features with heuristics based knowledge of experts under a common, rules based, expert shell named CLIPS (C Language Integrated Production System). In contrast to previous ES, the knowledge base of the DSS has been designed to be dynamic by superimposing CLIPS on Structured Query Language (SQL). The proposed ES has an inbuilt calibration module that enables calibration of an existing (aged) WDN for the unknown, and unobservable, Hazen-Williams C-values. In addition, the daily run and simulation modules of the proposed ES further enable the CLIPS inference engine to evaluate the network performance for any emergent or suggested test scenarios. An additional feature of the proposed design is that the DSS integrates computational platforms such asMATLAB, open source Geographical Information System (GIS), and a relational database management system (RDBMS) working under the umbrella of the Microsoft Visual Studio based common user interface.

Design/methodology/approach - Special attention is paid to the CIM-based information model defined as the ontology to be used in this framework and the AI-based reasoning mechanisms and components used to perform the conflict discovery tasks over the distributed firewall policies. Findings - Mechanisms presented allow the solving some of the current issues of the network-centric security model being used in the Internet. The two-tier framework designed provides semantic-aware mechanisms to perform conflict detection and automatic enforcement of policy rules in the distributed firewall scenario. This framework is based on the use of a standard information model and a semantic-aware policy language to formally define (and then process) firewall policies. Research limitations/implications - Ongoing work is focused on identifying all kind of conflicts and anomalies that may exist in firewall systems; in parallel to this task a semi-automatic resolver of conflicting policies is currently under design. Practical implications - Network and security administrators can specify firewall policies and validate them to find syntactic and semantic errors (i.e. policy conflicts). A framework for automated validation and distribution of policies at different levels is included. This ensures that firewall policies produce the desired effects, facilitating the creation and maintenance of firewall rules in one administrative domain. Originality/value - A practical and novel two-tier system that provides detection of conflicts in rules existing in a distributed firewall scenario and the automatic and secure deployment of these rules. A packet-filtering model, which is simple and powerful enough for the conflict discovery and rule analysis processes, has been proposed. Moreover, ontology and rule reasoning are being proposed as techniques for the conflict detection problem in this particular scenario. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2-s2.0-34548061300"

Is humanity ready or willing to accept machines as moral advisors? The use of various sorts of machines to give moral advice and even to take moral decisions in a wide variety of contexts is now under way. This raises some interesting and difficult ethical issues. It is not clear how people will react to this development when they become more generally aware of it. Nor is it clear how this technological innovation will affect human moral beliefs and behavior. It may also be a development that has long-term implications for our understanding of what it is to be human. This chapter will focus on rather more immediate and practical concerns. If this technical development is occurring or about to occur, what should our response be? Is it an area of science in which research and development should be controlled or banned on ethical grounds? What sort of controls, if any, would be appropriate?. As a first move it is important to separate the question “Can it be done and, if so, how?” from the question “Should it be done?” There are, of course, overlaps and interdependencies between these two questions. In particular, there may be technical ways in which it should be done and technical ways in which it shouldn't be done. For example, some types of artificial intelligence (AI) systems (such as conventional rule-based systems) may be more predictable in their output than other AI technologies. © Cambridge University Press 2011.","2-s2.0-84927058642"

StrokeDx has been extended to include knowledge about a genetic stroke syndrome, Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). A clinical discovery of 2 new CADASIL mutations is reported. Mutation 1 is a G to T transversion at nucleotide position 2077 with an amino acid substitution glycine to cysteine. Mutation 2 is a C to T transversion at nucleotide position 2227 with an amino acid substitution arginine to cysteine. CADASIL is frequently misdiagnosed and software tools to aid diagnosis are required. GOAL: Augment StrokeDx with knowledge (clinical, genetics, examination, MRI analysis) about CADASIL. METHODS: A new CADASIL specific rule set was encoded using the StrokeDx prolog-like system. Test case data were analyzed by StrokeDx. RESULTS: StrokeDx computed diagnostic confidence factor of 1.0 for the CADASIL case and computed much lower factors for other non-CADASIL strokes. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke Dx has demonstrated technical flexibility, encoding of CADASIL-specific rules was efficient, and the resulting expert system is more powerful AI system.","2-s2.0-84863700593"

In the paper, the meaning of fault isolation performance is formalized by using the established notion of coverage and false coverage from the field of statistics. Then formal relations describing the relationship between fault isolation performance and the residual related design parameters are derived. For small faults, the measures coverage and false coverage are not applicable so therefore, a different performance criteria, called sub-coverage, is proposed. The performance of different AI-based fault isolation schemes is evaluated and it is shown that the well known principle of minimal cardinality diagnosis gives a very bad performance. Finally, some general design guidelines that guarantee and maximize the fault isolation performance are proposed.

This approach employs a fuzzy rule-based system (FRBS), which is augmented with an appropriate metaheuristic (direct search) technique to automate the tuning of the system parameters within an online adaptive rolling horizon framework. The proposed hybrid FRBS is used to nonlinearly combine traffic flow forecasts resulting from an online adaptive Kalman filter (KF) and an artificial neural network (ANN) model.

Common sense knowledge also provides the background knowledge for humans to successfully operate in social situations where such knowledge is typically assumed. In order for machines to exploit common sense knowledge in reasoning as humans do, moreover, we need to endow them with human-like reasoning strategies. In this work, we propose a two-level affective reasoning framework that concurrently employs multi-dimensionality reduction and graph mining techniques to mimic the integration of conscious and unconscious reasoning, and exploit it for sentiment analysis.

Methods: Data were extracted from a prospective TDM study of 199 HIV-infected patients (CCTG 578). Lopinavir (LPV) and efavirenz (EFV) pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were modelled using a Bayesian method and interpreted by an expert committee of HIV specialists and pharmacologists who made TDM recommendations. These PK models and recommendations formed the knowledge base to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system that could estimate drug exposure, interpret PK data and generate TDM recommendations. The modelled PK exposures and expert committee TDM recommendations were considered optimum and used to validate results obtained by the AI system. Results: A group of patients, 67 on LPV, 46 on EFV and three on both drugs, were included in this analysis. Correlations were high for LPV and EFV estimated trough and 4 h post-dose concentrations between the AI estimates and modelled values (r>0.79 for all comparisons; P<0.0001). Although trough concentrations were similar, significant differences were seen for mean predicted 4 h concentrations for EFV (4.16 μg/ml versus 3.89 μg/ml; P=0.02) and LFV (7.99 μg/ml versus 8.79 μg/ml; P<0.001). The AI and expert committee TDM recommendations agreed in 53 out of 69 LPV cases [kappa (κ)=0.53; P<0.001] and 47 out of 49 EFV cases (κ=0.91 ; P<0.001).

Our goal is to create an integrated intelligent system that can combine observed facts, hand-written rules, learned rules, and learned classifiers to perform joint learning and reasoning. Our solution, which has been implemented in the CALO system, integrates multiple learning components with a Markov Logic inference engine, so that the components can benefit from each other's predictions. We introduce two designs of the learning and reasoning layer in CALO: the MPE Architecture and the Marginal Probability Architecture. The architectures, interfaces, and algorithms employed in our two designs are described, followed by experimental evaluations of the performance of the two designs. We show that by integrating multiple learning components through Markov Logic, the performance of the system can be improved and that the Marginal Probability Architecture performs better than the MPE Architecture.

However, the interpretation of surface EMG is a difficult task that assumes extensive knowledge and experience. As such, this noninvasive procedure is not frequently used in the general clinical routine. An Artificial Intelligence (AI) system for interpreting surface EMG signals and the resulting muscular coordination patterns could overcome these limitations. To support such interpretation, an expert system based on fuzzy inference methodology was developed. The knowledge-base of the system implemented 15 rules, from which the fuzzy inference methodology performs a prediction of the effectiveness of the muscular coordination during gait. Our aim was to assess the feasibility and value of such an expert system in clinical applications. Surface EMG signals were recorded from the tibialis anterior, soleus muscle, and gastrocnemius muscles of children with CP to assess muscular coordination patterns of ankle movement during gait. Nineteen children underwent 114 surface EMG measurements. Simultaneously, the gait cycles of each patient were determined using foot switches and videotapes. From the EMG signals, the effectiveness of the ankle movement was predicted by the expert system, and predictions were classified using a three-point ordinal scale. In 91 cases (80%), the clinical findings matched the predictions of the expert system. In 23 cases (20%) the predictions of the expert system differed from the clinical findings with 12 cases revealing worse and 11 cases revealing better results in comparison to the clinical findings. As this study is a first attempt to verify the feasibility and correctness of this expert system, the results are promising.

Rules generated by IXL are incorporated into a prototype expert system, ACQTARGET, which evaluates corporate acquisitions. The use of confidence factors in ACQTARGET allows investors to specifically incorporate uncertainties into the decision making process. A set of training examples comprising 65 acquired and 65 non-acquired real world firms is used to generate the rules and a separate holdout sample containing 32 acquired and 32 non-acquired real world firms is used to validate the expert system results. The performance of the expert system is also compared with a conventional discriminant analysis model and a logit model using the same data. The results show that the expert system, ACQTARGET, performs as well as the statistical models and is a useful evaluation tool to classify firms into acquisition and non-acquisition target categories.

The issue we would like to address in this paper is: Can a unified representational scheme be used in learning processes as well as the various levels of cognitive processing from concept representation to problem solving including the generation of action plans? In a previous paper we defined a set of representations called ""atomic operational representations"" that employs an explicit representation of the temporal dimension and that can be used to ground concepts in the physical world, such as concepts that involve various activities and interactions. In this paper we apply operational representations in a unified manner to the following cognitive processes: 1) the unsupervised learning and encoding of causal rules of actions and their consequences; and 2) the application of the learned causal rules to problem solving processes that produce desired action plans. The unique and explicit temporal characteristic of operational representations is the key feature that allows the encoded concepts to be used in a unified manner across the various levels of cognitive processing. Hence, abstractions in the form of operational representations have an important role to play in AI. Copyright © 2013, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

However, the poor comprehensibility hinders the success of the SVM for protein structure prediction. The explanation of how a decision made is important for accepting the machine learning technology, especially for applications such as bioinformatics. The reasonable interpretation is not only useful to guide the ""wet experiments,"" but also the extracted rules are helpful to integrate computational intelligence with symbolic AI systems for advanced deduction. On the other hand, a decision tree has good comprehensibility. In this paper, a novel approach to rule generation for protein secondary structure prediction by integrating merits of both the SVM and decision tree is presented. This approach combines the SVM with decision tree into a new algorithm called SVM_DT, which proceeds in three steps. This algorithm first trains an SVM. Then, a new training set is generated through careful selection from the output of the SVM. Finally, the obtained training set is used to train a decision tree learning system and to extract the corresponding rule sets. The results of the experiments of protein secondary structure prediction on RS126 data set show that the comprehensibility of SVM_DT is much better than that of the SVM.

This includes a discussion of how certain mathematical techniques for testing AI systems can be used as criteria for determining the AI System's adequacy when no other models are available. We give an example of an error due to widespread rule interactions. Such errors are the keys to understanding why the independent rule assumption does not work, and therefore why AI systems must be modeled. We examine how testing can be applied both to individual system components as well as to the system as a whole. We also submit different criteria by which a set of test cases can be assembled and the problems in determining whether or not the performance of an AI system on a set of test cases is acceptable. In the end, the article shows the results of applying this model to a real case. © 2007 IEEE.","2-s2.0-46449105201"

It is arguable that intelligent systems must involve some amount of complexity, and so the global behavior of AI systems would therefore not be expected to have an analytic relation to their constituent mechanisms. This has serious implications for the methodology of AI. This paper suggests that AI researchers move toward a more empirical research paradigm, referred to as “theoretical psychology,” in which systematic experimentation is used to discover how the putative local mechanisms of intelligence relate to their global performance. There are reasons to expect that this new approach may allow AI to escape from a trap that has dogged it for much of its history: on the few previous occasions that something similar has been tried, the results were both impressive and quick to arrive. © 2007 The authors and IOS Press.

Because human cognition is dynamic and involves change over time, accounts of cognition often take the form of process models, which are sometimes called cognitive models. This chapter reviews the form such models have taken and their relation to order effects in learning. It begins by discussing the connection between artificial intelligence (AI) systems, including those from machine learning and computational models of human behavior, including some illustrations of the latter. It presents a computational model of order effects on a cognitive task, cast within a particular but simplified theoretical framework. It then explores more broadly the possible sources of order effects within such models and then briefly considers an alternative approach that models human behavior at a more abstract level.

This study is aimed to develop an automated update scheme using an Adaptive Neuro‐Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). Method and Materials: An ANFIS is a technique developed for modelling a special type of FIS originally introduced by Sugeno [1]. The Sugeno‐type FIS has similar structure as the conventional Mamdani‐type FIS, and can update itself based on the observation data. Without the prior planner's knowledge, a Sugeno‐type FIS can adjust itself to adapt supervising signal, i.e. training data. It is a great leap over conventional Mamdani‐type FIS. For experimental purpose, one set of training and testing data were obtained from the observations of the input‐output responses of a Mamdani‐type FIS previously constructed by human knowledge. Then, the model of Sugeno‐type FIS was iteratively adjusted by a gradient‐descent algorithm. As learning procedure was completed, it was examined by the testing data and the error between the outputs of Sugeno‐type and Mamdani‐type FIS was evaluated. Results: With the same training data set and testing data set for both systems, the discrepancy between the outputs of Sugeno‐type FIS and Mamdani‐type FIS is within 2% and varies by 3%. Conclusion: With adequate training data and training epoch, the Sugeno‐type FIS can effectively approximate the function of Mamdami‐type FIS. The result indicates that it is possible to build a self‐learning AI system for parameter optimization of IMRT treatment planning.

It concerns the study of ""graduai"" rules, which makes it possible to represent correlations and modulation relations between variables. We propose a set of characteristics to identify these gradual rules, and a classification of these rules into ""direct"" rules and ""modulation"" rules. In neurobiology, pre-synaptic neuronal connections lead to gradual processing and modulation of cognitive information. While taking as a starting point such neurobiological data, we propose in the field of connectionism the use of ""Sigma-Pi"" connections to allow gradual processing in AI systems. In order to represent as well as possible the modulation processes between the inputs of a network, we have created a new type of connection, ""Asymmetric Sigma-Pi"" (ASP) units. These models have been implemented within a pre-existing hybrid neuro-symbolic system, the INSS system, based on connectionist nets of the ""Cascade Correlation"" type. The new hybrid system thus obtained, INSS-Gradual, allows the learning of bases of examples containing gradual modulation relations. ASP units facilitate the extraction of gradual rules from a neural network.","2-s2.0-9444243850"

The individual models were then integrated via four different approaches: calculation of an average, a Bayesian approach, and two fuzzy logic models, the first based purely on current and past river flow conditions and the second, a fuzzification of the crisp Bayesian method. Model performance was assessed using global statistics and a more specific flood related evaluation measure.

This game can be summarized as playing chess backwards in time, from any end board state to the initial state, in a competitive fashion, with players alternating turns. The first player to achieve the starting configuration (or other predetermined winning configuration) is the winner. The moves in IChess are generally the moves in chess played backwards (e.g. bringing in a piece into the board (spawning) instead of killing, king giving an inverse check ...). There are a couple of exceptions - pawns can be brought in and also removed. The game is quite enjoyable, with about 70% of a few hundred college students liking it in trials. It is also computationally very challenging, from multiple viewpoints - game theoretic, graph theoretic, etc. The state space of IChess is larger than that of Chess, since there are non-chess positions reachable in IChess. As such sophisticated AI based approaches are needed to develop a competent computer player. Our AI player uses (pruned) min-max search, plus heuristics which try to emulate the logic of a human player. The min-max search is based on a board evaluation metric (BEM), which is a non-linear function of board state features. The BEM itself can be improved using learning techniques. Our AI player is capable of beating a beginner level human opponent when run on a contemporary laptop (3GHz, 512 MB RAM unoptimized). We expect to be able to present results from a player which is capable of beating about 90% of human opponents by the time of the conference.","2-s2.0-82855181569"

This allows humans to adapt easily to novel situations where AI fails catastrophically for lack of situation-specific rules and generalization capabilities. In order for machines to exploit common sense knowledge in reasoning as humans do, moreover, we need to endow them with human-like reasoning strategies. In problem-solving situations, in particular, several analogous representations of the same problem should be maintained in parallel while trying to solve it so that, when problem-solving begins to fail while using one representation, the system can switch to one of the others.

Owing to limitations on available expertise, and reach-ability of experts, and engineers and academics, designing these products is a very complicated and timeconsuming process. Also, not much research has been carried out developing tools, methods and computer supported systems for dealing with significant issues in electromechanical product design. As a result, a multi-disciplinary design approach is needed to effectively address the above problems. In this research paper, a new artificial intelligence (AI) based product development approach has been proposed for integrating mechanical design with electronic design to improve design and manufacture of electromechanical products within given requirements. The proposed approach has been implemented in a Delphi based environment integrated with a CAD system. To firmly understand relationships between each component in a complex system some existing products have been examined and modeled in terms of constraints, rules and frames. The system assists designers from different disciplines in evaluating complex systems as far as parts relation, potential effects on each other, costs, weight and physical constraints are concerned in the early stages of the design process.

Of which one of the better developed technique is Expert Control (EC)[1][2] by Karl J. Astrom. The Integrated Process Supervision (IPS) [3][4] is a structured refinement of the EC architecture [5] that allows the integration of different control techniques (both AI-based and analytical techniques) within a single generic framework. This is achieved in IPS through the classification of system behaviour into: acceptable, malfunction and faulty behaviours [3][4] according to certain system performance measurement using a simple thresholding detection mechanism. This technique raises two important research issues, namely, the choice of the thresholds between the classes of system behaviours, and the sensitivity of such thresholding mechanism to uncertainty and noise during the determination of system behaviours. This paper attempts to address the second issue by using fuzzy sets instead of crisp behaviour categorisation to represent system behaviours. Extensive experimental results have shown that the use of fuzzy sets provides significant noise tolerance in the switching mechanism. Furthermore, different levels of noise tolerance can be achieved by modifying the shape of the fuzzy sets. The use of a fuzzy rule-base for process scheduling greatly improves the transparency of the integrated process supervisor as well as the modularity of the IPS scheme.","2-s2.0-0030377273"

Rules in the CTSHIV knowledge base encode knowledge about sequence mutations in the HIV genome that have been found to result in drug resistance in the HIV virus. Rules are applied to the actual HIV sequences of the virus strains infecting the specific patient undergoing clinical treatment in order to infer current drug resistance. A search through mutation sequence space identifies nearby drug resistant mutant strains that might arise. The possible drug treatment regimens currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are considered and ranked by their estimated ability to avoid identified current and nearby drug resistant mutants. The highest-ranked treatments are recommended to the attending physician. The result is more precise treatment of individual HIV patients, and a decreased tendency to select for drug resistant genes in the global HIV gene pool. The application is currently in use in human clinical trials on HIV patients. Initial results from a small clinical trial are encouraging and further clinical trials are planned.

This paper focuses on Automated Learning for Conceptual Discrimination tasks, and in particular on the application of the new Machine Learning system RIGEL to a domain of industrial image recognition. This original way of applying learning to image recognition is aimed at enhancing the artificial vision system by providing it with learning capabilities.

Like symbolic AI systems, they offer a comprehensible representation, which facilitates transfer of knowledge between the system and human experts and users. Moreover, unlike symbolic systems, the responses are more gradual. When human expertise is used to build a fuzzy controller, it must often be tuned to fit particular objectives or simply be corrected when it is incomplete or otherwise incorrect. When such expertise does not exist or is difficult to acquire and model in the controller, the knowledge must be generated. In either case, it is desirable to perform these tasks automatically. This can be accomplished by searching the space of all controllers, while sampling their performance to provide heuristic quality measures. This requires a robust search mechanism. Moreover, the search should be conducted simultaneously at all representation levels to avoid any assumptions about the knowledge. Generic algorithms provide the necessary robustness. In this paper we investigate their applications to simultaneous manipulations of all representation levels. A number of experiments is conducted and reported, which illustrate both the tuning and learning capabilities of the approach. © 1994 ACM.","2-s2.0-85006734185"

This paper presents an inductive method that is capable of detecting the inherent patterns in such a sequence and to make predictions about the attributes of future events. Unlike previous AI-based prediction methods, the proposed method is particularly effective in discovering knowledge in ordered event sequences even if noisy data are being dealt with. The method can be divided into three phases: (i) detection of underlying patterns in an ordered event sequence; (ii) construction of sequence-generation rules based on the detected patterns; and (iii) use of these rules to predict the attributes of future events. The method has been implemented in a program called OBSERVER-II, which has been tested with both simulated and real-life data. Experimental results indicate that it is capable of discovering underlying patterns and explaining the behaviour of certain sequence-generation processes that are not obvious or easily understood. The performance of OBSERVER-II has been compared with that of existing AI-based prediction systems, and it is found to be able to successfully solve prediction problems programs such as SPARC have failed on. © 1994 IEEE","2-s2.0-0028516580"

Despite the plethora of these methodologies and standards, and the myriad text books associated with software engineering, there is still a huge gap between good practice and current common practice in industry. It is suggested here that, in order to get industry to accept and use these methodologies, it is vital that there are concise, coherent guidelines, and also usable and affordable tools to assist software engineers in their jobs. It is also necessary to re-educate many experienced programmers, and to try to dispel some of the many myths and rumours that surround the use of these techniques.

Methods for the analysis of the structure and physicochemical properties of molecules referred to include topological analysis, molecular orbital calculations, input of chemical structures, molecular modelling, cluster analysis and pattern recognition. Emphasis is placed on the importance of identifying substructural fragments of sufficient size and physicochemical specificity to act as toxicophores. Procedures for processing structural information include decision‐tree and probabilistic systems, as well as algebraic and related statistical analyses for obtaining quantitative structure‐activity relationships (QSARs). The principal differences between knowledge‐based and automated rule‐induction expert systems, and their utilisation for predicting the activity of chemicals, are discussed by reference to the use of several methods, including DEREK, HAZARDEXPERT, COMPACT, CASE and TOPKAT.

In the past few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods for control and scheduling of manufacturing systems have gained considerable attention. A fundamental advantage of AI methods, in contrast to algorithmic approaches, is in the ability to take a ""reformulated approach"" to scheduling problems. However, most of the existing paradigms of AI methods (e.g. expert system shells) restrict the user to a particular inference strategy and representation method. In many cases, these paradigms are not flexible nor powerful enough to take the full advantage of AI methods. In this paper, an inference structure is described which allows the designer of an AI-based scheduling system to take advantage of (1) a data-driven strategy to move forward from existing knowledge to new conclusions; (2) a goal-driven strategy to prove or disprove a goal for hypothesis by examining its supporting evidence; (3) a simulation interface to conduct ""what-if"" analysis of the future states of the modeled system, and (4) a direct LISP interface in the form of ""rule-programs,"" which allows various algorithmic procedure, search strategies, and problem-specific inferencing methods to be adopted easily. © 1990.","2-s2.0-0025672466"

GRAIL II is a hybrid AI system that supports a number of DNA sequence analysis tools including protein-coding region recognition, PolyA site and transcription promoter recognition, gene model construction, translation to protein, and DNA/protein database searching capabilities. This paper presents the core of GRAIL II, the coding exon recognition and gene model construction algorithms. The exon recognition algorithm recognizes coding exons by combining coding feature analysis and edge signal (acceptor/donor/translation-start sites) detection. Unlike the original GRAIL system (Uberbacher and Mural, 1991; Mural et al., 1992), this algorithm uses vaxiable-length windows tailored to each potential exon candidate, making its performance almost exon lengthindependent. In this algorithm, the recognition process is divided into four steps, hdtially a large number of possible coding exon candidates are generated. Then a rule-based prescreening algorithm eliminates the majority of the improbable candidates. As the kernel of the recognition algorithm, three neural networks are trained to evaluate the remaining candidates. The outputs of the neural networks are then divided into clusters of candidates, corresponding to presumed exons. The algorithm makes its final prediction by picking the best candidate from each cluster. The gene construction algorithm (Xu, Mural and Uberbacher, 1994) uses a dynamic programming approach to build gene models by using as input the clusters predicted by the exon recognition algorithm. Extensive testing has been done on these two algorithms. The exou recognition algorithm is a significant improvement over the original GRAIL system, and the gene construction algorithm further improves the prediction results. © 1994, AAAI (www.aaai.org).

Determining how fast an expert system can respond under all possible situations is a difficult problem. We have developed an efficient analysis methodology for a large class of rule-based EQL programs to determine whether a program in this class has bounded response time. In particular, we have identified several sets of primitive behavioral constraint assertions: an EQL program which satisfies all constraints in one of these sets of assertions is guaranteed to have bounded response time. Here, we enhance the applicability of our analysis technique by introducing a facility with which the rule-based programmer can specify application-specific knowledge that is too difficult to be mechanically detected in the new language Estella in order to determine the performance of an even wider range of programs.

Simulation integration of AI systems is a useful tool for exercising and debugging rule-based/knowledge-based AI systems. One might expect, for example, to find one or more intelligence components (in the form of an expert system) integrated into a real-time flight simulator. These intelligent components might be inserted as instructors in a training simulator or as tactical decision aids for a pilot operating in an advanced cockpit. The Pilot’s Associate program is a good example of proposed on-board use of several expert systems in an advanced cockpit, with staged testing in flight simulators. When such expert systems are initially integrated, problems may show up in the presence of the real-time simulation which did not appear during expert systems developmen. Advances in computer technology have enabled significant gains in AI technology. This cross-feed of technologies has been generally supportive of AI system integration. The integration of an AI system presents a special set of problems. If nothing else, the executive nature of the AI system is asynchronous with respect to the simulation and the input/output is symbolic. This paper discusses sources of problems that arise from AI system integration as well as progress towards solution of these problems. A few sources are, for example: comlexity of communication interfaces, time delays in response to AI system advisories, use of dissimilar computers (AI system host with respect to simulation) and use of different languages or versions of the same language. © 1990 General Dynamics Corporation.

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques have been developed to support various operations management activities. This research describes the use of one such AI technique, namely rule induction, to improve forecasting accuracy. Specifically, the proposed methodology involves 'training' a rule induction-based expert system (ES) with a set of time series data (the 'training' set). Inputs to the ES include selected time series features, and for each time series, the most accurate forecasting method from those available. Subsequently, the ES is used to recommend the most accurate forecasting method for a new set of time series (the 'testing' set). The results of this experiment, which appear promising, are presented, together with guidelines for the methodology's use.

They can be used to represent reasoning rules, reactive desires, desires for acquiring knowledge, preconditions and effects of actions as well as plan decompositions. A rational engine module operates on these representations and is responsible for the agent's reasoning and acting behavior.

This system prepares an optimum refueling plan, controls the fuel handling facilities by that plan, displays and prints out the history of transfer and storage of items by automatically sampled data on a work station, a network to express fuel handling facilities and operational rules acquired through operating experiences.

Currently available human factors methods and data bases can be used for design at the physical and perceptual levels. However, due to the fact that these systems typically support complex cognitive processes, the critical interface takes place at the cognitive level. Unfortunately, work on cognitive factors for AI applications is in its infancy. The paper looks at the direction this work must take to become more beneficial to the design community. It is argued that the most useful work will build on information being compiled by researchers in cognitive science. These researchers are developing models of how humans perform complex tasks such as diagnostic inference, problem solving, and decision making. This information will provide the first building blocks: a basic taxonomy of the mental processes underlying various types of cognitive task. The next requirement would be the empirical study of the basic types of system that maximally support the various cognitive processes identified in the taxonomy. The result would be an expanded taxonomy of tasks and subtasks and their associated guidelines for computer support systems. The support systems would vary along a number of parameters including the type of underlying knowledge base, degree of task control, information presentation, interface style, and so forth. The team developing an expert system or other cognitive support system would perform a cognitive task analysis and then refer to this knowledge base for guidelines on system design, given the particular combination of cognitive processes being performed.","2-s2.0-0025554692"

Consideration of attributes shared to some degree by human problem solvers leads to focusing in greater detail on one of the more successful procedures, tabu search, which employs a flexible memory system (in contrast to “memoryless” systems, as in simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, and rigid memory systems as in branch and bound and A* search). Specific attention is given to the short‐term memory component of tabu search, which has provided solutions superior to the best obtained by other methods for a variety of problems. Our development emphasizes the principles underlying the interplay between restricting the search to avoid unproductive retracing of paths (by means of tabu conditions) and freeing the search to explore otherwise forbidden avenues (by aspiration criteria). Finally, we discuss briefly the relevance of a supplementary framework, called target analysis, which is a method for determining good decision rules to enable heuristics to perform more effectively.

A real-time expert system makes critical decisions that are used to guarantee the safety and progress of the environment in which they are embedded. However, these decisions are only useful if they are produced within the timing constraints imposed by the environment. Thus it is required not only to verify the logical correctness of a real-time expert system but also to determine whether the computation time required to compute a logically correct decision in each monitor-decide cycle is within the imposed timing constraint. A principal concept in our analysis methodology is that of a special form of rules. A set of rules satisfying all behavioral constraint assertions of a special form is guaranteed to have bounded response time. However, our earlier work does not provide the techniques for computing a tight response time bound for a set of rules once this rule set is found to have bounded response time. This paper presents efficient algorithms for computing tight response time bounds for rule sets with bounded response time.

An important link between empirically based investigations of neural network classification models and the correct application of these models to AI-based systems is established. General expressions are derived relating the performance of the Hopfield model to the number and dimensionality of code vectors stored in memory. The average performance of the network is analyzed by randomizing the subsequent code vectors and examining classification relative to the output bit errors. An exact probabilistic description of the network is derived for the first iteration, and an approximate second-moment analysis generalizable to multiple iterations examines performance near a fixed point. Degradations generated by noisy or incomplete input data are analyzed using the concept of stochastic Hamming distance. A link to statistical mechanics is established by showing that the average extensive energy function is related to the individual bit error probabilities for small Hamming distances. The results of our theoretical investigations show that the Hopfield net has major limitations when applied to fixed pattern classification problems because of its sensitivity to the number of code vectors stored in memory and the signal-to-noise ratio of the input data. © 1989 IEEE","2-s2.0-0024627293"

There have been events during which motor operated valves failed on demand due to improper switch settings. For nuclear electric generating stations, these events have led to regulatory requirements such as NRC Bulletin 85-03 and NRC Bulletin 89-10 'Safety Related Motor Operated Valve Testing and Surveillance' which imposes strict testing and programmatic requirements on motor operated valves (MOV). Part of the requirements include performing diagnostic testing to verify stem thrust loads and switch settings. Diagnostic equipment must be non-intrustive, minimize valve disassembly, and reduce plant refueling critical path time for testing. In this paper an on-line diagnostic system using sensors to measure stem forces, motor current, and valve position, and a portable system employing these same sensor inputs in addition to torque, limit and torque bypass switch inputs is described. Sophisticated graphic software is employed to display data or trace information. A rule based artificial intelligence (AI) system is used to analyze sensor outputs.

In some cases, AI-based concepts have provided frameworks for making traditional operations research (OR) techniques more accessible and usable in practical production management settings. In others, novel concepts and techniques have been developed that offer new opportunities for more costeffective factory performance. While this field of ‘knowledge-based’ production management is still fairly young and the literature is still dominated by experimental research systems, results are nonetheless starting to have an impact in actual production environments. In recent years, several systems have made their way into operation, and many have been attributed with substantial manufacturing performance gains. In this paper, we provide an overview of research in the field of knowledge-based production management. We begin by examining the important sources of decision-making difficulty in practical production management domains, discussing the requirements implied by each with respect to the development of effective production management tools, and identifying the general opportunities in this regard provided by AI-based technology. We then categorize work in the field along several different dimensions, indicating the principal types of manufacturing domains that have received attention, the particular production management and control activities that have been emphasized, and the various perspectives that have emerged with respect to the tradeoff that must be made in practical production management contexts between predictive decisionmaking to optimize behaviour and reactive decision-making to manage exccutional uncertainty. The bulk of the paper focuses on summarising the dominant approaches to knowledge-based production management that have emerged. Here, we identify the general concepts, principles, and techniques that distinguish various paradigms, characterize the strengths and weaknesses of each paradigm from the standpoint of different production management requirements, and indicate the results that work within each paradigm has produced to date. Among the paradigms for knowledge-based production management considered are rule-based scheduling, simulation-based scheduling, constraint-based scheduling, fuzzy scheduling, planning and scheduling, iterative scheduling, and interactive scheduling. We also examine work aimed at integrating heterogeneous planning and scheduling methods (both AI and OR based) and the construction of systems for multi-level production management and control. Finally, we survey more recent research in the areas of distributed production management and automated learning of factory floor control policies from experience. We conclude by discussing the current and future prospects of this work. In doing so, we also identify some of the important obstacles and challenges currently facing the field. © 1992 Taylor and Francis Ltd.","2-s2.0-0026936702"

This means that the system's behavior is to adapt to the learning process the student is subject to while working with the system. This in turn requires a powerful and flexible interface driven by a sophisticated management system which makes use of an on-line student model along with a psychologically valid, thus a cogni-tively plausible representation of the domain. We will present the AI-based learning environment DiBi which we have implemented as a microworld for a physical problem domain to address these topics. The DiBi system presents a form of disk billiard which embodies the laws underlying elastic impacts in classical mechanics. DiBi is based upon a rule-based domain representation and a graphical interface which allows interactions in a direct manipulation style. The acquisition of expertise on the part of the student can be understood as experienced-based inductive learning which takes place during the interaction with DiBi. The development of the notion of “evolutionary student models” is to support the underlying style of qualitative, case-oriented reasoning and to facilitate explanations and coaching. The basic idea is to achieve more consistency between the representation of the domain expertise and the knowledge acquisition processes going on while the domain is being explored by means of the system. © 1991, Elsevier Inc.

To date, most of the AI-based approaches used in automated process planning are some variations of knowledge-based expert systems. Due to their knowledge acquisition bottleneck, expert systems are not sufficient in solving process planning problems. Fortunately, AI has developed other techniques that are useful for knowledge acquisition, e.g., neural networks. Neural networks have several advantages over expert systems that are desired in today's manufacturing practice. However, very few neural network applications in process planning have been reported. We present this paper in order to stimulate the research on using neural networks for process planning.

In spite of the fact that there is a substantial number of design manuals and design procedures which process engineers can consult to choose the most proper approach to a particular problem, there is a remarkable lack of generality on the one side (procedures which apply to the design of a wastewater treatment process cannot be used even in principle to design a fluidized bed system), and an obvious repetitivity on the other side (all procedures involve mass and energy balances at some point). With the advance of numerical techniques, virtually every procedure has been computerized, so that engineers can avail themselves of a multitude of computer tools in the majority of their process design activities: as a result of the lack of coordination among different procedures though, the situation for what codes are concerned is very confusing: there are many codes which perform nominally the same task, giving (sometimes substantially!) different results when applied to the very same problem; each code uses its own set of property tables, its own I/O format, etc. Finally, with very few exceptions, these codes are not mutually compatible, i.e. the output from any of them cannot be used as the input to any of the other, not only because of the respective formats, but rather because the quantities taken to represent a certain physical process are not the same in different codes. This is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs, both for the final user and for the software producer. Unfortunately, this seems to be a problem for which commercial, technical and historical reasons make it very difficult to find a solution in the short term. The author is convinced that an early exposure to this problem and to a new approach to its solution can only benefit our engineering students, and has therefore endeavoured, together with his coworkers, to devise a ""modular approach"" to the solution of process simulation problems. The material presented here has been originated by a series of lectures and seminars developed in the last three years for master and doctoral level students in Mechanical Engineering. The result of this ""distillation"" process maybe yet unripe, as they are definitely not complete: but the implications, also in terms of practical applications, are very promising, and the approach deserves more attention in the future. The order of presentation of the material is historical/logical: it begins with the oldfashioned slide-rule calculations and proceeds towards the most recent developments of AI-based methods. The path is made clear from the very beginning: we are trying to extract from the various engineering activities all the essential knowledge which pertains to the engineer himself, with the final goal of transferring this body of knowledge - in some form suitable to machine communication - to a ""universal-process simulator"", which can then be applied with a high degree of confidence to a variety of particular process simulations.","2-s2.0-0030113783"

A major problem however, is that no single forecasting method is the most accurate for every data time series. Thus, generating a forecast is often an uncertain affair, involving the use of heuristics by human experts and/or the consistent use of forecasting models whose accuracy may or may not be the most accurate for that time series. To compound matters, the best forecasts are often produced by combining forecasting models. This research describes the use of an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based technique, rule-based induction, to improve forecasting accuracy. By using training sets of time series (and their features), induced rules were created to predict the most appropriate forecasting method or combination of methods for new time series. The results of this experiment, which appear promising, are presented, together with guidelines for its practical application. Potential benefits include dramatic reductions in the effort and cost of forecasting; the provision of an expert 'assistant' for specialist forecasters; and increases in forecasting accuracy. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Moreover, examination of such large systems reveals new phenomena and calls into question some common assumptions based on previous observations of smaller systems. We first show that the Rete and Treat match algorithms do not scale well with the number of rules in our systems, in part because the number of rules affected by a change to working memory increases with the total number of rules in these systems. We also show that the sharing of nodes in the beta part of the Rete network becomes more and more important as the number of rules increases.

Artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques are designed for capturing, representing, organizing, and utilizing knowledge by computers, and hence will play an important role in intelligent manufacturing. As an AI technique, knowledge-based expert systems have been used in manufacturing for nearly two decades. Recently, another AI technique, namely, neural networks, is gaining more and more visibility and has been successfully applied in manufacturing practice. Expert systems and neural networks are individually useful but not sufficient on their own in dealing with manufacturing problems. In fact, expert systems and neural networks are complementary. The weaknesses of expert systems are offset by the strengths of neural networks, and vice versa. Quite a few researchers are interested in merging the structures and functions of expert systems with those of neural networks. Some evidence has shown that the neural-expert hybrid technique is a promising tool for intelligent manufacturing.

The author describes the general principles underlying the testability analysis of analog circuits and systems performed by the automated testability expert system tool (AutoTEST) which is an artificial intelligence (AI) based CAE tool. The goal is to perform a testability analysis early in the design cycle to ensure conformance with diagnostic requirements. To meet this goal, AutoTEST was designed to perform an analysis with varying levels of component and circuit detail. AutoTEST supports both a top-down and a bottom-up approach. The analog and system level portions of AutoTEST provide test and design engineers with both quantitative measures and qualitative descriptions of the testability of a given design. Quantitative measures are testability figures of merit such as fraction of faults detected, fault isolation resolution, and average ambiguity group size. Qualitative descriptions of testability problems include identifying feedback loops and unique circuit configurations which are difficult to test. The qualitative analysis consists of a set of design rules that are applied to the circuit.

By contrast, this paper suggests that the role of a computer tutor in language learning need not necessarily be confined to that of a foreign language expert. It investigates ways in which to represent both the learner's L2 skills and the foreign language expert. These lead to a novel computational method for teaching a foreign language, suitable for children aged 7 to 15. The paper shows that Schank's conceptual dependency (CD) theory is one way of representing knowledge for a specific domain such as eating habits. It then goes on to show that the computer can monitor a dialogue about eating habits by pattem matching the Learner's and Corrector's conceptual dependency form against its own predefined script, and can then formulate further questions about the same topic, using a set of production rules. This enables it to act as an intelligent tutoring system for second language acquisition. Its role is supportive but similar to a communicative teaching strategy (CTS) in that L2 is learned independently of L1. The paper then shows how this communicative teaching strategy would fit in with a learning environment consisting of electronic mail penpals who act as both correctors and learners for their respective L2. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","2-s2.0-34248883823"

A basic logical reasoning tool (dual resolution) is recalled in brief and a formal definition of completeness of rule-based control systems is restated. The definition takes into account aspects of practical applications - context of rules execution and domain knowledge (intended interpretation); in fact specific logical completeness is defined. This type of completeness is also referred to as ψ-completeness, where ψ is the context-defining formula. A basic tool for support of the design process in the form of ψ-trees is defined. A ψ-tree constitutes a kind of semantic tree for specification of rules preconditions. The use of context defined by formula ψ allows for multi-level, hierarchical design of the rules. Any path in the tree corresponds in fact to application of one of the introduced rules. Two criteria for building complete ψ-trees are given.","2-s2.0-5544232017"

This paper addresses ways in which such potential can be achieved. Recent discussions of this topic have proposed a stronger integration between AIM applications and health information systems, and emphasize computer guidelines to support the new health care paradigms of evidence-based medicine and cost-effectiveness. These proposals, however, promote the initial definition of AIM applications as being AI systems that can perform or aid in diagnoses. We challenge this traditional philosophy of AIM and propose a new approach aiming at empowering health care workers to become independent self-sufficient problem solvers and decision makers. Our philosophy is based on findings from a review of empirical research that examines the relationship between the health care personnel's level of knowledge and skills, their job satisfaction, and the quality of the health care they provide. This review supports addressing the quality of health care by empowering health care workers to reach their full potential. As an aid in this empowerment process we argue for reviving a long forgotten AIM research area, namely, AI based applications for medical education and training. There is a growing body of research in artificial intelligence in education that demonstrates that the use of artificial intelligence can enhance learning in numerous domains. By examining the strengths of these educational applications and the results from previous AIM research we derive a framework for empowering medical personnel and consequently raising the quality of health care through the use of advanced AI based technology.; Several ways in which the potential benefits of artificial intelligence in medicine (AIM) can be achieved are discussed.

Presently this task is carried out manually resulting in an overdesigned, costly, and nonstandardized solution. As an ill-structured and open-ended problem, plat design is difficult to automate with conventional approaches such as operational research or CAD. Additional complexity in automating plat design is imposed by the need to process spatial data such as circuits' maps, records, and construction plans. The intelligent decision support system for automated electrical plat design (IDSS for AEPD) is an engineering tool aimed at automating plate design. IDSS for AEPD combines the functionality of geographic information systems (GIS) a geographically referenced database, with the sophistication of artificial intelligence (AI) to deal with the complexity inherent in design problems. Blackboard problem solving architecture, concentrated around INGRES relational database and NEXPERT object expert system shell have been chosen to accommodate the diverse knowledge sources and data models. The GIS's principal task it to create, structure, and formalize the real world representation required by the rule based reasoning portion of the AEPD. IDSS's capability to support and enhance the engineer's design, rather than only automate the design process through a prescribed computation, makes it a preferred choice among the possible techniques for AEPD. This paper presents the results of knowledge acquisition and the knowledge engineering process with AEPD tool conceptual design issues. To verify the proposed concept, the comparison of results obtained by the AEPD tool with the design obtained by an experienced human designer is given.","2-s2.0-0026652221"

In the case the response time of the rule-based system is not acceptable, it has to be optimized to meet both timing and integrity constraints. This paper describes a novel approach to reduce the response time of rule-based expert systems. Our optimization method is twofold: the first phase constructs the reduced cycle-free finite state transition system corresponding to the input rule-based system, and the second phase further refines the constructed transition system using the simulated annealing approach. The method makes use of rule-base system decomposition, concurrency and state-equivalency. The new and optimized system is synthesized from the derived transition system. Compared with the original system, the synthesized system has (1) fewer number of rule firings to reach the fixed point, (2) is inherently stable, and (3) has no redundant rules. © 1994 SPIE.

However, the important concept in the D-S theory that the belief and plausibility functions are lower and upper probabilities is no longer preserved in these generalizations. In this paper, we describe a generalized theory of evidence where the degree of belief in a fuzzy set is obtained by minimizing the probability of the fuzzy set under the constraints imposed by a basic probability assignment. To formulate the probabilistic constraint of a fuzzy focal element, we decompose it into a set of consonant non-fuzzy focal elements. By generalizing the compatibility relation to a possibility theory, we are able to justify our generalization to Dempster's rule based on possibility distribution. Our generalization not only extends the application of the D-S theory but also illustrates a way that probability theory and fuzzy set theory can be combined to deal with different kinds of uncertain information in AI systems. © 1990, Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85012659860"

The traditional approach to solve such a “match phase problem” for production systems is to use the Rete Match Algorithm. Here, a new technique using a multilayer perceptron, a particular artificial neural network model, is presented to solve the match phase problem for rule-based AI systems. a syntax for premise formulas (i.e., the left-hand-sides of the rules) is defined, and working memory is specified. From this, it is shown how to construct a multilayer perceptron that finds all of the rules which can be executed for the current situation in working memory. The complexity of the constructed multilayer perceptron is derived in terms of the maximum number of nodes and the required number of layers. a method for reducing the number of layers to at most three is also presented. © 1992 IEEE.","2-s2.0-0026882070"

This trend has been aptly portrayed as an evolution away from machine-like programming towards knowledge programming. With more sophisticated tools, the knowledge engineer has less concern for computer specifics and is also capable of “programming” major portions of the “control” processing portion of programs by specifying knowledge. One powerful representational system—conceptual structures that continue the trend towards knowledge programming—is examined. Sowa's conceptual structures approach, a graph-based semantic network, is a general representational system with a natural language expressivity. This allows problem domain issues to be readily captured and expressed at several levels of granularity. Conceptual graph (CG) propositions can also act as a flexible intermediate form for the more common representations used in implementing many AI systems—frames, production rules, conceptual dependency, and logic systems—that is, CG knowledge models are capable of symbolic translation into forms that are more familiar. Issues of expressively capturing the semantics of problem domains are discussed. The conceptual structures approach offers a convenient vehicle for building of a repository of general knowledge. Such general knowledge is potentially useful to tie together a wide range of related domains. Early research on the present system has demonstrated how “background” knowledge, both declarative and procedural, stored in conceptual graphs, can be integrated with specific knowledge. In the current implementation, experimentation with management of diverse knowledge types using a conceptual graph form is presented. While this effort is just beginning, it offers the possibility of producing a front-end knowledge engineering system designed to store knowledge in a general form, translate information at the knowledge level into a variety of popular forms at the symbol level, and employ general knowledge about knowledge objects, world thing/processes, and graphical expressions of the two. © 1989 IEEE","2-s2.0-0024668321"

However, in the presence of sources of uncontrolled combinatorics, it is extremely difficult to guarantee such bounds on their performance. In production systems, the primary source of uncontrolled combinatorics is the production match. To eliminate these combinatorics, the unique-attribute formulation was introduced in (Tambe and Rosenbloom, 1989), which achieved a linear bound on the production match. This formulation leads to several questions: is this unique-attributes formulation the best conceivable production system formulation? In fact, are there other alternative production system formulations? If there are other formulations, how should these alternatives be compared with the unique-attribute formulation? This paper attempts to address these questions in the context of Soar. It identifies independent dimensions along which alternative production system formulations can be specified. These dimensions are based on the fixed class of match algorithms currently employed in production systems. These dimensions create a framework for systematically generating alternative formulations. Using this framework we show that the unique-attribute formulation is the best one within the dimensions investigated. However, if a new class of match algorithms is admitted, by relaxing certain constraints, other competitor formulations emerge. The paper indicates which competitor formulations are promising and why. Although some of the concepts, such as unique-attributes, are introduced in the context of Soar, they should also be relevant to other rule-based systems.  Copyright © 1990, AAAI (www.aaai.org).

The aim is to help future research concerning the application of AI to constraint based scheduling, by evaluating the progress that has been made in this area. © 1991.","2-s2.0-0026137120"

The purpose of this project is to explore methods of combining multiple AI technologies into a hybrid intelligent diagnostic and advisory system. ANNs and ESs have different strengths and weaknesses, which can be exploited in such a way that they are complementary to each other: strengths in one system make up for weaknesses in the other, and vice versa. There is, presently, considerable interest in ways to exploit the strengths of these methodologies to produce an intelligent system which is more robust and flexible than one using either technology alone. Any process which involves both data-driven (bottom-up) and concept-driven (top-down) processing is especially well suited to displaying the capabilities of such a hybrid system. The system can take an incoming pattern of signals, as from various points in an automated manufacturing process, and make intelligent process control decisions on the basis of the pattern as preprocessed by the ANNs, with rule-based heuristic help or corroboration from the ES. Patterns of data from the environment which can be classified by either the ES or a human consultant can result in a high-level ANN being created and trained to recognize that pattern on future occurrences. In subsequent cases in which the ANN and the ES fail to agree on a decision concerning the environmental situation, the system can resolve those differences and retrain the networks and/or modify the models of the environment stored in the ES. Work on a hybrid system for perception in machine vision has been funded initially by an Oak Ridge National Laboratory seed grant, and most of the system components are operating presently in a parallel distributed computer environment. © 1991 Chapman & Hall.","2-s2.0-0012023181"

Six detailed knowledge bases demonstrate the application of various AI-based systems to industrial engineering problems. They illustrate a number of approaches: expert systems, which are based upon practical experience; decision systems, which derive from modelling skills; and situation-action systems, which rely on production process design skills. The six paradigms presented describe a logical expert system for selecting material handling equipment; a multi-valued expert system for selecting a dispatching rule for automatic guided vehicles; a profile matching expert system for selecting project management software; a confidence building expert system for selecting a machine feeder; a tandem decision system for developing a production schedule; and a situation-action system for controlling job allocation in a flexible manufacturing cell. The relationships between these various paradigms and the characteristics of problems to which they can be applied are categorized by the nature of the expert and his expertise; the features of the environment; the decision or decisions to be taken; and the manner in which AI-system performance can be evaluated.

The objectives of this system development is to provide man-machine system analysts with detailed information on the cognitive process of an operator and the plant behavior affected by operator's actions in accidental situations of an NPP (nuclear power plant). The simulation system consists of an operator model and a plant model which are coupled dynamically. The operator model simulates an operator's cognitive behavior in accidental situations based on the decision ladder model of Rasmussen, and is implemented using the AI-techniques of the distributed cooperative inference method with the so-called blackboard architecture. Rule-based behavior is simulated using knowledge representation with If-Then type of rules. Knowledge-based behavior is simulated using knowledge representation with MFM (Multilevel Flow Modeling) and qualitative reasoning method. Cognitive characteristics of attentional narrowing, limitation of short-term memory, and knowledge recalling from long-term memory are also modeled. The plant model of a 3-loop PWR is also developed using a best estimate thermal-hydraulic analysis code RELAP5/MOD2. Some simulations of incidents were performed to verify the human model. It was found that AI-techniques used in the human model are suitable to simulate the operator's cognitive behavior in an NPP accident.

They all construct a classification rule which partitions measurement space into target sets. Advantages and drawbacks of different methods are highlightened by simple examples. Error analyses enable deeper understanding of the learning and classification process in real world domains, characterized by incomplete and noisy data. Good error estimate is based on the balance between bias and variance. A deviation of the Laplacean error estimate is presented. We presented new mechanisms that use redundant knowledge in the explicit form. One of such systems, GINESYS (Generic INductive Expert SYstem Shell) is shortly presented. Heuristic reasoning and empirical results indicate that a proper use of redundant knowledge significantly increases classification accuracy. Over 10 basic AI and statistical systems were tested on two oncological domains. Results show that older AI methods provide usable information regarding the structure of data, but, on the other hand, their classification accuracy is often lower than that of the statistical methods. Standard statistical systems often achieve good classification accuracy, but are more or less non-transparent to users.

Previous work focused on the construction of general-purpose intelligent systems; the emphasis was on powerful inference methods that could function efficiently even when the available domain-specific knowledge was relatively meager. Today the emphasis is on the role of specific and detailed knowledge, rather than on reasoning methods.The first successful application of this method, which goes by the name of knowledge-based or expert-system research, was the DENDRAL program at Stanford, a long-term collaboration between chemists and computer scientists for automating the determination of molecular structure from empirical formulas and mass spectral data. The key idea is that knowledge is power, for experts, be they human or machine, are often those who know more facts and heuristics about a domain than lesser problem solvers. The task of building an expert system, therefore, is predominantly one of “teaching” a system enough of these facts and heuristics to enable it to perform competently in a particular problem-solving context. Such a collection of facts and heuristics is commonly called a knowledge base. Knowledge-based systems are still dependent on inference methods that perform reasoning on the knowledge base, but experience has shown that simple inference methods like generate and test, backward-chaining, and forward-chaining are very effective in a wide variety of problem domains when they are coupled with powerful knowledge bases. If this methodology remains preeminent, then the task of constructing knowledge bases becomes the rate-limiting factor in expert-system development. Indeed, a major portion of the applied AI research in the last decade has been directed at developing techniques and tools for knowledge representation. We are now in the third generation of such efforts. The first generation was marked by the development of enhanced AI languages like Interlisp and PROLOG. The second generation saw the development of knowledge representation tools at AI research institutions; Stanford, for instance, produced EMYCIN, The Unit System, and MRS. The third generation is now producing fully supported commercial tools like KEE and S.1. Each generation has seen a substantial decrease in the amount of time needed to build significant expert systems. Ten years ago prototype systems commonly took on the order of two years to show proof of concept; today such systems are routinely built in a few months. Three basic methodologies—frames, rules, and logic—have emerged to support the complex task of storing human knowledge in an expert system. Each of the articles in this Special Section describes and illustrates one of these methodologies. “The Role of Frame-Based Representation in Reasoning,” by Richard Fikes and Tom Kehler, describes an object-centered view of knowledge representation, whereby all knowldge is partitioned into discrete structures (frames) having individual properties (slots). Frames can be used to represent broad concepts, classes of objects, or individual instances or components of objects. They are joined together in an inheritance hierarchy that provides for the transmission of common properties among the frames without multiple specification of those properties. The authors use the KEE knowledge representation and manipulation tool to illustrate the characteristics of frame-based representation for a variety of domain examples. They also show how frame-based systems can be used to incorporate a range of inference methods common to both logic and rule-based systems.”Rule-Based Systems,” by Frederick Hayes-Roth, chronicles the history and describes the implementation of production rules as a framework for knowledge representation. In essence, production rules use IF conditions THEN conclusions and IF conditions THEN actions structures to construct a knowledge base. The autor catalogs a wide range of applications for which this methodology has proved natural and (at least partially) successful for replicating intelligent behavior. The article also surveys some already-available computational tools for facilitating the construction of rule-based knowledge bases and discusses the inference methods (particularly backward- and forward-chaining) that are provided as part of these tools. The article concludes with a consideration of the future improvement and expansion of such tools.The third article, “Logic Programming, ” by Michael Genesereth and Matthew Ginsberg, provides a tutorial introduction to the formal method of programming by description in the predicate calculus. Unlike traditional programming, which emphasizes how computations are to be performed, logic programming focuses on the what of objects and their behavior. The article illustrates the ease with which incremental additions can be made to a logic-oriented knowledge base, as well as the automatic facilities for inference (through theorem proving) and explanation that result from such formal descriptions. A practical example of diagnosis of digital device malfunctions is used to show how significantand complex problems can be represented in the formalism.A note to the reader who may infer that the AI community is being split into competing camps by these three methodologies: Although each provides advantages in certain specific domains (logic where the domain can be readily axiomatized and where complete causal models are available, rules where most of the knowledge can be conveniently expressed as experiential heuristics, and frames where complex structural descriptions are necessary to adequately describe the domain), the current view is one of synthesis rather than exclusivity. Both logic and rule-based systems commonly incorporate frame-like structures to facilitate the representation of large amounts of factual information, and frame-based systems like KEE allow both production rules and predicate calculus statements to be stored within and activated from frames to do inference.

But discovering the metarules, which govern this decision-making process is a challenging and rewarding project. Teaching a computer turns out to be a very effective way to learn how to teach people the same skill. By first teaching the computer how people write, you can then teach people with all the logical steps needed by the computer. You model the human's writing process; then, you model the computer's learning process. Although much remains to be done, Vivace has already produced a great deal of interesting information about the chorale-writing process, which I am compiling into a primer for my first-year theory students. The next stage of development will deal with more complex chords, modulation, melody writing and phrase parsing. Vivace has been under development for a little over a year. We are just beginning to reap the benefits of its knowledge. Presently, we are preparing to port the system to a SUN advanced-function work station. With some further modularization of rules, we hope to eventually use this tool in the classroom to help demonstrate the impact of various procedures intuitively employed by the masters of the past.

These problem domains are of special interest because they are typified by complex dynamic environments in which the ability to select and initiate a proper response to environmental events in real time is a strict prerequisite to effective environmental interaction. Artificial intelligence systems developed to date have been sheltered from this real-time requirement, however, largely by virtue of their use of simplified problem domains or problem representations. The plethora of colloquial and (in general) mutually inconsistent interpretations of the term “real-time” employed by workers in each of these domains further exacerbates the difficulties in effectively applying state-of-the-art problem solving techniques to time-critical problems. Indeed, the intellectual waters are by now sufficiently muddied that the pursuit of a rigorous treatment of intelligent real-time performance mandates the redevelopment of proper problem perspective on what “real-time” means, starting from first principles. We present a simple but nonetheless formal definition of real-time performance. We then undertake an analysis of both conventional techniques and AI technology with respect to their ability to meet substantive real-time performance criteria. This analysis provides a basis for specification of problem-independent design requirements for systems that would claim real-time performance. Finally, we discuss the application of these design principles to a pragmatic problem in real-time signal understanding. © 1985 SPIE.","2-s2.0-0021793720"

In this paper I present a view of the connectionist approach that implies that the level of analysis at which uniform formal principles of cognition can be found is the subsymbolic level, intermediate between the neural and symbolic levels. Notions such as logical inference, sequential firing of production rules, spreading activation between conceptual units, mental categories, and frames or schemata turn out to provide approximate descriptions of the coarse-grained behaviour of connectionist systems.
