Despite the recent and rapid advancements in developing next-gen AI-based techniques, we continue to lack a systemic understanding of how AI, ML, and DL can fundamentally be integrated into the structural engineering domain. To advocate for a smooth and expedite the adoption of AI techniques into our field, we present a state-of-the-art review that is specifically tailored to structural engineers. This review aims to serve three purposes: (1) introduce the art and science of AI, ML, and DL in terms of its commonly used algorithms and techniques with particular attention to those of high value to this domain, (2) map the current knowledge within this domain through a scientometrics analysis of more than 4000 scholarly works with a focus on those published in the last decade to identify best practices in terms of procedures, performance metrics, and dataset size etc., and (3) review past and recent efforts that applied AI derivatives into the various subfields within structural engineering. Special attention is given to the application of AI, ML, and DL in earthquake, wind, and fire engineering, as well as structural health monitoring, damage detection, and prediction of properties of structural materials as collected from over 200 sources. Finally, a discussion on trends, recommendations, best practices, and advanced topics towards the end of this review.","","Naser, MZ (Corresponding Author), Clemson Univ, Glenn Dept Civil Engn, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.

Equally important to technical advancement is human, social, and contextual factors that impact the successful implementation and user adoption of AI-empowered CDSS (AI-CDSS). With the growing interest in human-centered design and evaluation of such tools, it is critical to synthesize the knowledge and experiences reported in prior work and shed light on future work. Methods: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a systematic review to gain an in-depth understanding of how AI-empowered CDSS was used, designed, and evaluated, and how clinician users perceived such systems. We performed literature search in five databases for articles published between the years 2011 and 2022. A total of 19874 articles were retrieved and screened, with 20 articles included for in-depth analysis. Results: The reviewed studies assessed di erent aspects of AI-CDSS, including e ectiveness (e.g., improved patient evaluation and work eficiency), user needs (e.g., informational and technological needs), user experience (e.g., satisfaction, trust, usability, workload, and understandability), and other dimensions (e.g., the impact of AI-CDSS on workflow and patient-provider relationship). Despite the promising nature of AI-CDSS, our findings highlighted six major challenges of implementing such systems, including technical limitation, workflow misalignment, attitudinal barriers, informational barriers, usability issues, and environmental barriers. These sociotechnical challenges prevent the e ective use of AI-based CDSS interventions in clinical settings. Discussion: Our study highlights the paucity of studies examining the user needs, perceptions, and experiences of AI-CDSS. Based on the findings, we discuss design implications and future research directions.","artificial intelligence; clinical decision support system; human-centered AI; user experience; healthcare; literature review","Zhang, Z (Corresponding Author), Pace Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Informat Syst, New York, NY 10038 USA.

In such applications, a large amount of data is generated about diverse aspects of our life. Although utilizing AI in real-world applications provides numerous opportunities for societies and industries, it raises concerns regarding data privacy. Data used in an AI system are cleaned, integrated, and processed throughout the AI life cycle. Each of these stages can introduce unique threats to individual's privacy and have an impact on ethical processing and protection of data. In this paper, we examine privacy risks in different phases of the AI life cycle and review the existing privacy-enhancing solutions. We introduce four different categories of privacy risk, including (i) risk of identification, (ii) risk of making an inaccurate decision, (iii) risk of non-transparency in AI systems, and (iv) risk of non-compliance with privacy regulations and best practices. We then examined the potential privacy risks in each AI life cycle phase, evaluated concerns, and reviewed privacy-enhancing technologies, requirements, and process solutions to countermeasure these risks. We also reviewed some of the existing privacy protection policies and the need for compliance with available privacy regulations in AI-based systems. The main contribution of this survey is examining privacy challenges and solutions, including technology, process, and privacy legislation in the entire AI life cycle.

Some researchers argue that AI-enable network may run the danger of having private information compromised. We still need a backup rule-based methodology to allocate bandwidth resource to each slice, if the AI-based method suddenly encounters security issues. To design such a rule-based methodology, this study attempts to answer two questions: (1) Is the network slicing bandwidth allocation problem the nondeterministic polynomial-time completeness (NP-completeness)? (2) Is there a heuristic methodology without any training process, which has equivalent performance compared to the AI-based methodology? This study first proves the classical network slicing bandwidth allocation problems is NP-completeness. This shows that the designed heuristic method is inescapably suboptimal to the network slicing bandwidth allocation problem. Secondly, this study proposes the Adaptive Hungarian Algorithm (AHA), which outperforms previous AI-empowered method and does not need any training process. The experiments demonstrate that AHA reached 93%-97% of the maximal system throughput by brute-and-force algorithm, compared to other methodologies only having at most 93% of the maximal system throughput. This also indicates that AHA is capable to solve the network slicing bandwidth allocation problem, if the telecommunication operators do not have sufficient sample complexity to train an AI model.","channel allocation; complexity; network slicing; NP-completeness","Chen, YH (Corresponding Author), Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Informat Management, Nursing & Hlth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.

This paper formulates an ethically aligned AI system framework and discusses pre-eminent on-demand AI systems in wildlife conservation. The proposed framework uses agile software life cycle methodology to implement guidelines towards the ethical upgrade of any existing AI system or the development of any new ethically aligned AI system. The guidelines enforce, among others, the minimisation of intentional harm and bias, diversity in data collection, design compliance, auditing of all activities in the framework and ease of code inspection. This framework will inform AI developers, users, conservationists, and policymakers on what to consider when integrating AI Ethics into AI-based systems for wildlife conservation.","Wildlife conservation concerns; Human-wildlife conflicts; AI Ethics; AI in wildlife conservation; AI Ethics integration; Artificial intelligence","Nandutu, I (Corresponding Author), Rhodes Univ, Dept Math, ZA-6139 Grahamstown, South Africa.

Some enhanced technologies for 5G like equipment deep sleep and symbol aggregation have also been introduced in this article. However, it is far from enough and an innovative energy-saving solution should be considered. To meet the requirements and development of intelligent and self-adaptive energy-saving solution, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data analysis are introduced to form a more precise energy-saving strategy based on site-specific traffic and site-related conditions, thus improving the efficiency and reducing the manpower. Finally, two commercial application practices of AI-based energy-saving solution are elaborated. One is the practice of AI-based service awareness energy saving for 4G/5G collaborative networks, the energy benefits can be improved up to 20%; The other practice is the adoption of a new architecture Active Antenna Unit (AAU) with beam pattern optimization, its energy benefits can be promoted by 30%.

However, there is a lack of consolidated design guidelines for information systems facilitating the collaboration between humans and AI systems. This work examines how agent transparency affects trust and task outcomes in the context of human-AI collaboration. Drawing on the 3-Gap framework, we study agent transparency as a means to reduce the information asymmetry between humans and the AI. Following the Design Science Research paradigm, we formulate testable propositions, derive design requirements, and synthesize design principles. We instantiate two design principles as design features of an information system utilized in the hospitality industry. Further, we conduct two case studies to evaluate the effects of agent transparency: We find that trust increases when the AI system provides information on its reasoning, while trust decreases when the AI system provides information on sources of uncertainty.

However, there currently is a lack of knowledge, especially systematically derived design knowledge, regarding customer trust in interacting with AI-based chatbots. In this context, a lack of security and transparency, limited social features, and the communication style and quality-related issues of AI-based chatbots are just a few aspects that inhibit customer trust in interacting with this innovative technology, thereby hindering the adoption of chatbots. To address this knowledge gap, we adopted a design theory-based approach and developed a design concept for trust-supporting design knowledge regarding customer interaction with an AI-based chatbot. Design science provides a structured development and evaluation process to support, for example, the adoption of AI-based chatbots. Drawing on trust-based literature, a use case in customer service in the automotive industry, and seven semi-structured expert interviews, we propose 10 meta/user requirements and four design principles for trust-supporting design elements as (e.g. social) signals (stimuli) regarding the interaction with AI-based chatbots. We developed two click prototypes over two evaluation cycles. Each evaluation included an online survey with 180 participants. The findings that were obtained make a valuable contribution to solving the described lack of design knowledge by developing and evaluating different design approaches in the form of prototypical user interfaces.

Hence, seeking plausible solutions to minimise building energy demands and mitigate adverse environmental impacts is necessary. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine and deep learning have been increasingly and successfully applied to develop solutions for the built environment. This review provided a critical summary of the existing literature on the machine and deep learning methods for the built environment over the past decade, with special reference to holistic approaches. Different AI-based techniques employed to resolve interconnected problems related to heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and enhance building performances were reviewed, including energy forecasting and management, indoor air quality and occupancy com-fort/satisfaction prediction, occupancy detection and recognition, and fault detection and diagnosis. The present study explored existing AI-based techniques focusing on the framework, methodology, and performance. The literature highlighted that selecting the most suitable machine learning and deep learning model for solving a problem could be challenging. The recent explosive growth experienced by the research area has led to hundreds of machine learning algorithms being applied to building performance-related studies. The literature showed that existing research studies considered a wide range of scope/scales (from an HVAC component to urban areas) and time scales (minute to year). This makes it difficult to find an optimal algorithm for a specific task or case. The studies also employed a wide range of evaluation metrics, adding to the challenge. Further developments and more specific guidelines are required for the built environment field to encourage best practices in evaluating and selecting models. The literature also showed that while machine and deep learning had been successfully applied in building energy efficiency research, most of the studies are still at the experimental or testing stage, and there are limited studies which implemented machine and deep learning strategies in actual buildings and conducted the post-occupancy evaluation.","Artificial intelligence; Building energy management; Deep learning; Heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC); Indoor environmental quality (IEQ); Machine learning; Occupancy detection; Thermal comfort","Tien, PW (Corresponding Author), Univ Nottingham, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.

Accordingly, promising research activities focus on debiasing to strengthen fairness, accountability and transparency in machine learning. There is, though, a tendency to fix societal and ethical issues with technical solutions that may cause additional, wicked problems. Alternative analytical approaches are thus needed to avoid this and to comprehend how societal and ethical issues occur in AI systems. Despite various forms of bias, ultimately, risks result from eventual rule conflicts between the AI system behavior due to feature complexity and user practices with limited options for scrutiny. Hence, although different forms of bias can occur, automation is their common ground. The paper highlights the role of automation and explains why deep automation bias (DAB) is a metarisk of AI. Based on former work it elaborates the main influencing factors and develops a heuristic model for assessing DAB-related risks in AI systems. This model aims at raising problem awareness and training on the sociotechnical risks resulting from AI-based automation and contributes to improving the general explicability of AI systems beyond technical issues.","artificial intelligence; machine learning; automation bias; fairness; transparency; accountability; explicability; uncertainty; human-in-the-loop; awareness raising","Strauss, S (Corresponding Author), Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Technol Assessment ITA, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.

This paper deals with the practical implementation of deep learning methods for increasing safety and security in a specific ITS scenario: railway crossings. This research work presents our proposed system called Artificial Intelligence-based Surveillance System for Railway Crossing Traffic (AISS4RCT) that is based on a combination of detection and classification methods focusing on various image processing inputs: vehicle presence, pedestrian presence, vehicle trajectory tracking, railway barriers at railway crossings, railway warnings, and light signaling systems. The designed system uses cameras that are suitably positioned to capture an entire crossing area at a given railway crossing. By employing GPU accelerated image processing techniques and deep neural networks, the system autonomously detects risky and dangerous situations at railway crossing in real-time. In addition, camera modules send data to a central server for further processing as well as notification to interested parties (police, emergency services, railway operators).

However, most of the modern AI techniques (e.g., Machine Learning - ML) have a black box nature, which hinder their adoption by practitioners in many application fields. This issue raises a recent emergence of a new research area in AI called Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), aiming at providing AI-based decision-making processes and outcomes to be easily understood, interpreted, and justified by humans. Since 2018, there has been an exponential growth of research studies on XAI, which has justified some review studies. However, these reviews currently focus on proposing taxonomies of XAI methods. Yet, XAI is by nature a highly applicative research field, and beyond XAI methods, it is also very important to investigate how XAI is concretely used in industries, and consequently derive the best practices to follow for better implementations and adoptions. There is a lack of studies on this latter point. To fill this research gap, we first propose a holistic review of business applications of XAI, by following the Theory, Context, Characteristics, and Methodology (TCCM) protocol. Based on the findings of this review, we secondly propose a methodological and theoretical framework in six steps that can be followed by all practitioners or stakeholders for improving the implementation and adoption of XAI in their business applications. We particularly highlight the need to rely on domain field and analytical theories to explain the whole analytical process, from the relevance of the business question to the robustness checking and the validation of explanations provided by XAI methods. Finally, we propose seven important future research avenues.","Explainable artificial intelligence; XAI; Interpretable artificial intelligence; Interpretable machine learning; Deep learning; Business applications; Framework; Management; TCCM","Tchuente, D (Corresponding Author), TBS Business Sch, Dept Informat Operat & Management Sci, 1 Pl Alphonse Jourdain CS 66810, F-31068 Toulouse 7, France.

Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are particularly vulnerable, and their cybersecurity issues are receiving greater attention. However, existing research on cybersecurity has limited referencing value for HEI leaders and policy-makers because they are usually technology-focused. Publications that showcase best practices often lack system-wide perspectives towards cybersecurity in HEIs. Our paper, therefore, aims to bridge this literature gap and generate institutional cybersecurity strategies for HEI leaders and policy-makers from a system perspective. We first review how the cybersecurity landscape has evolved over the last few decades and its latest trends and projections for the next decade. By analysing these historical developments and new changes, we further illuminate the importance of strengthening HEI cybersecurity capacities. As we explore why HEIs face severe challenges to tackle the ever-escalating cyberattacks, we propose a system-wide approach to safeguard HEI cybersecurity and highlight the necessity to reassess prioritised areas. By taking an extensive literature review and desk research of methods that could respond to the cybersecurity vulnerabilities of the next decade, we synthesise our findings with a set of institutional strategies, with takeaways designed to equip HEIs better to address cybersecurity threats into the future. The strategies include: (1) Strengthening Institutional Governance for Cybersecurity; (2) Revisiting Cybersecurity KPIs; (3) Explicating Cybersecurity Policies, Guidelines and Mechanisms; (4) Training and Cybersecurity Awareness Campaigns to Build Cybersecurity Culture; (5) Responding to AI-based Cyber-threats and Harnessing AI to Enhance Cybersecurity; (6) Introduction of New and More Sophisticated Security Measures; (7) Paying Attention to Mobile Devices Use, Using Encryption as a Daily Practice; and (8) Risk Management. We believe that cybersecurity can be safeguarded throughout the new decade when these strategies are considered thoroughly and with the concerted effort of relevant HEI stakeholders.","cybersecurity; cyber threats; management strategies; KPI; higher education","Cheng, ECK; Wang, TC (Corresponding Author), Educ Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ & Human Dev, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

Due to the difficulty of quantifying PD in the past, doctors have tended to focus on some signs while ignoring others, primarily relying on an intuitive assessment scale because of the disease's characteristics, which include loss of motor control and speech that can be utilized to detect and diagnose this disease. It is an illness that impacts both motion and non-motion functions. It takes years to develop and has a wide range of clinical symptoms and prognoses. Parkinson's patients commonly display non-motor symptoms such as sleep problems, neurocognitive ailments, and cognitive impairment long before the diagnosis, even though scientists have been working to develop designs for diagnosing and categorizing the disease, only noticeable defects such as movement patterns, speech, or writing skills are offered in this paper. This article provides a thorough analysis of several AI-based ML and DL techniques used to diagnose PD and their influence on developing additional research directions. It follows the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR).

Although design principles suggest methods to avoid CS, challenges remain as new demands and systems continue to penetrate the competitive market. The dilemma is whether to use VR technology by experiencing the ultimate virtual world using a head-mounted display (HMD) with possible CS triggers or to avoid the triggers by avoiding using VR. With the huge success and potential in the entertainment industry, it is very important to focus on the solutions to handling CS dilemmas. Therefore, the main observation for the developers is to have a guide around the set of established design principles aiming to broadly reduce CS. In this paper, we provide a method to apply artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and use machine learning (ML) algorithms including support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees (DTs) and K-nearest neighbours (KNNs) to predict CS outcomes. Based on our findings, we have observed that DT and SVM surpassed KNN in test accuracy. Additionally, DT exhibited better results than both SVM and KNN in train accuracy. By exploiting the power of ML, developers will be able to predict the potential occurrence of CS while developing VR projects to find ways to alleviate CS more effectively.","Cybersickness (CS); Virtual reality (VR); Head-mounted displays (HMDs); Machine learning (ML); Artificial intelligence (AI); Support vector machines (SVMs); Decision trees (DTs); K-nearest neighbours (KNNs)","Shafiabady, N (Corresponding Author), Charles Darwin Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Haymarket, NSW 2000, Australia.

While AI-based homecare systems are being developed, the perspectives of chronic patients, who are one of the primary beneficiaries and risk bearers of these technologies, remain largely under-researched. While recent research has highlighted the importance of AI-based homecare systems, the current understanding of patients' desired designs and features is still limited. Objective: This paper explores chronic patients' perspectives regarding AI-based homecare systems, an area currently underrepresented in research. We aim to identify the factors influencing their decision to use such systems, elucidate the potential roles of government and other concerned authorities, and provide feedback to AI developers to enhance adoption, system design, and usability and improve the overall healthcare experiences of chronic patients. Method: A web-based open-ended questionnaire was designed to gather the perspectives of chronic patients about AI-based homecare systems. In total, responses from 181 participants were collected. Using Krippendorff's clustering technique, an inductive thematic analysis was performed to identify the main themes and their respective subthemes. Result: Through rigorous coding and thematic analysis of the collected responses, we identified four major themes further segmented into thirteen subthemes. These four primary themes were: 1) ``Personalized Design'', emphasizing the need for patients to manage their health condition better through personalized and educational resources and user-friendly interfaces; 2) ``Emotional & Social Support'', underscoring the desire for AI systems to facilitate social connectivity and provide emotional support to improve the well-being of chronic patients at home; 3) ``System Integration & Proactive Care'', addressing the importance of seamless communication, proactive patient monitoring and integration with existing healthcare platforms; and 4) ``Ethics & Regulation'', prioritizing ethical guidelines, regulatory compliance, and affordability in the design. Conclusion: This study has offered significant insights into the needs and expectations of chronic patients regarding AI-based home care systems. `The findings highlight the importance of personalized and accessible care, emotional and social support, seamless system integration, proactive care, and ethical considerations in designing and implementing such systems. By aligning the design and operation of these systems with the lived experiences and expectations of patients, we can better ensure their acceptance and effectiveness.","Artificial Intelligence; Chronic patients; Governance systems; Health Informatics; Qualitative study; Digital health","Asan, O (Corresponding Author), Stevens Inst Technol, Sch Syst & Enterprises, 1 Castle Point Terrace, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA.

Findings The authors' synthesis of the literature suggests that AI system communication for end users has five high-level goals: (1) understandability, (2) trustworthiness, (3) transparency, (4) controllability and (5) fairness. The authors identified several design recommendations, such as offering personalized and on-demand explanations and focusing on the explainability of key functionalities instead of aiming to explain the whole system. There exists multiple trade-offs in AI system explanations, and there is no single best solution that fits all cases. Research limitations/implications Based on the synthesis, the authors provide a design framework for explaining AI systems to end users.

It is designed to test software, which are complex in nature and it is difficult to compute test oracle for them against a given set of inputs. Metamorphic testing approach tests the software with the help of metamorphic relations that guide the tester to check if the observed output can be produced after applying a certain input. Since its first appearance, a lot of research has been done to check its effectiveness on different complex families of software applications like search engines, compilers, artificial intelligence (AI) and so on. Artificial intelligence has gained immense attention due to its successfully application in many of the computer science and even other domains like medical science, social science, economic, and so on. AI-based applications are quite complex in nature as compared to other conventional software applications and because of that they are hard to test. We have selected specifically testing of AI-based applications for this research study. Although all the researchers claim to propose the best set of metamorphic relations to test AI-based applications but that still needs to be verified. In this study, we have performed a critical review supported by rigorous set of parameters that we have prepared after thorough literature survey. The survey shows that researchers have applied metamorphic testing on applications that are either based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) or Machine Learning (ML). Our analysis has helped us identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approaches. Research still needs to be done to design a generalized set of metamorphic rules that can test a family of AI applications rather than just one. The findings are supported by strong arguments and justified with logical reasoning. The identified problem domains can be targeted by the researchers in future to further enhance the capabilities of metamorphic testing and its range of applications.","Metamorphic testing; metamorphic relation; test oracle problem; artificial intelligence; genetic algorithm; machine learning","Bashir, MB (Corresponding Author), IQRA Univ, Comp & Technol Dept, Islamabad, Pakistan.

It was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It has resulted in an ongoing pandemic that caused infected cases including many deaths. Coronavirus is primarily spread between people during close contact. Motivating to this notion, this research proposes an artificial intelligence system for social distancing classification of persons using thermal images. By exploiting YOLOv2 (you look at once) approach, a novel deep learning detection technique is developed for detecting and tracking people in indoor and outdoor scenarios. An algorithm is also implemented for measuring and classifying the distance between persons and to automatically check if social distancing rules are respected or not. Hence, this work aims at minimizing the spread of the COVID-19 virus by evaluating if and how persons comply with social distancing rules. The proposed approach is applied to images acquired through thermal cameras, to establish a complete AI system for people tracking, social distancing classification, and body temperature monitoring. The training phase is done with two datasets captured from different thermal cameras. Ground Truth Labeler app is used for labeling the persons in the images. The proposed technique has been deployed in a low-cost embedded system (Jetson Nano) which is composed of a fixed camera. The proposed approach is implemented in a distributed surveillance video system to visualize people from several cameras in one centralized monitoring system. The achieved results show that the proposed method is suitable to set up a surveillance system in smart cities for people detection, social distancing classification, and body temperature analysis.","COVID-19; Neural network; Social distancing; Temperature analysis; Jetson nano; Distributed surveillance system","Saponara, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Pisa, Dip Ingn Informaz, Via G Caruso 16, I-56122 Pisa, Italy.

As an essential protocol to solve service-based communication, Scalable service-Oriented MiddlewarE over IP (SOME/IP) is expected to be applied to an in-vehicle network (IVN). The increasing number of external attack interfaces and the protocol's vulnerability makes SOME/IP in-vehicle networks vulnerable to intrusion. This paper proposes a multi-layer intrusion detection system (IDS) architecture, including rule-based and artificial intelligence (AI)-based modules. The rule-based module is used to detect the SOME/IP header, SOME/IP-SD message, message interval, and communication process. The AI-based module acts on the payload. We propose a SOME/IP dataset establishment method to evaluate the performance of the proposed multi-layer IDS. Experiments are carried out on a Jetson Xavier NX, showing that the accuracy of AI-based detection reached 99.7761% and that of rule-based detection was 100%. The average detection time per packet is 0.3958 ms with graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration and 0.6669 ms with only a central processing unit (CPU).

The traditional information extraction techniques are limited in their functionality, but AI-based techniques can provide a better solution. A thorough investigation of AI-based techniques for automatic information extraction from unstructured documents is missing in the literature. The purpose of this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is to recognize, and analyze research on the techniques used for automatic information extraction from unstructured documents and to provide directions for future research. The SLR guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Charters were adhered to conduct a literature search on various databases between 2010 and 2020. We found that: 1. The existing information extraction techniques are template-based or rule-based, 2. The existing methods lack the capability to tackle complex document layouts in real-time situations such as invoices and purchase orders, 3. The datasets available publicly are task-specific and of low quality. Hence, there is a need to develop a new dataset that reflects real-world problems. Our SLR discovered that AI-based approaches have a strong potential to extract useful information from unstructured documents automatically. However, they face certain challenges in processing multiple layouts of the unstructured documents. Our SLR brings out conceptualization of a framework for construction of high-quality unstructured documents dataset with strong data validation techniques for automated information extraction. Our SLR also reveals a need for a close association between the businesses and researchers to handle various challenges of the unstructured data analysis.","Organizations; Information retrieval; Optical character recognition software; Data mining; Automation; Standards organizations; Bibliographies; Artificial Intelligence (AI); document analysis; information extraction; named entity recognition (NER); optical character recognition (OCR); robotics process automation (RPA); unstructured data","Ahirrao, S (Corresponding Author), Symbiosis Int Deemed Univ, Symbiosis Inst Technol, Pune 412115, Maharashtra, India.

A detailed taxonomy of the related AI-based techniques of HetNets is also shown by discussing the pros and cons for various AI-based techniques for different problems in HetNets. Opening research issues and pending challenges are concluded as well, which can provide guidelines for future research work.","Artificial intelligence; genetic algorithms; ant colony optimization; self-organization networks; heterogeneous networks","Wang, XF (Corresponding Author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.

The trials and tribulations of the healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic have set the stage for shifting healthcare from a physical to a cyber-physical space. A physician can now remotely monitor a patient, admitting them only if they meet certain thresholds, thereby reducing the total number of admissions at the hospital. Coordination, communication, and resource management have been core issues for any industry. However, it is most accurate in healthcare. Both systems and providers are exhausted under the burden of increasing data and complexity of care delivery, increasing costs, and financial burden. Simultaneously, there is a digital transformation of healthcare in the making. This transformation provides an opportunity to create systems of care that are artificial intelligence-enabled. Healthcare resources can be utilized more justly. The wastage of financial and intellectual resources in an overcrowded healthcare system can be avoided by implementing IoT, telehealth, and AI/ML-based algorithms. It is imperative to consider the design principles of the patient's journey while simultaneously prioritizing a better user experience to alleviate physician concerns. This paper discusses the entire blueprint of the AI/ML-assisted patient journey and its impact on healthcare provision.","artificial intelligence; acute patient journey; electronic-triage; health IoT; Automated EMR summary; AI-based clinical decision support system","Nazir, T (Corresponding Author), NeuroCare AI Neurosci Acad, Dallas, TX 89148 USA.

A quantitative, modular, AI-based approach for assessing and grading students' collaboration has been examined in this article. The pedagogical underpinning of the approach includes a pedagogical framework and a quantitative soft skill assessment rubric, which have been adapted and used in an extracurricular Java programming course. The objective was to identify pros and cons of using different AI methods within this approach when it comes to assessing and grading collaboration in group programming projects. More specifically, fuzzy rules and several machine learning methods (ML onward) have been examined to see which one would yield the best results regarding performance, interpretability/explainability of recommendations, and feasibility/practicality. The data used for training and testing span four academic years, and the results suggest that almost all of the examined AI methods, when used within the proposed AI-based approach, can provide adequate grading recommendations as long as teachers cover other aspects of the assessment not covered by the rubrics: code quality, plagiarism, and project completion. The fuzzy-rule-based method requires time and effort to be spent on (manual) creation and tuning of fuzzy rules and sets, whereas the examined ML methods require lesser initial investments but do need historical data for training. On the other hand, the fuzzy-rule-based method can provide the best explanations on how the assessment/grading was made-something that proved to be very important to teachers.","Collaboration; Codes; Software engineering; Measurement; Teamwork; Market research; Electronic mail; Automatic assessment tools; collaboration; computer science education; fuzzy systems; machine learning (ML); soft skills","Tomic, BB (Corresponding Author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Dept Software Engn, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.

While data-driven FDD methods nowadays outperform the majority of traditional FDD approaches, such as the physically based models and mathematically based models, in terms of both efficiency and accuracy, the interpretability of those methods does not grow significantly. Instead, according to the literature survey, the interpretability of the data-driven FDD methods becomes the main concern and creates barriers for those methods to be adopted in real-world industrial applications. In this study, we reviewed the existing data-driven FDD approaches for building mechanical & electrical engineering (M&E) services faults and discussed the interpretability of the modern data-driven FDD methods. Two data-driven FDD strategies integrating the expert reasoning of the faults were proposed. Lists of expert rules, knowledge of maintainability, international/local standards were concluded for various M&E services, including heating, ventilation air-conditioning (HVAC), plumbing, fire safety, electrical and elevator systems based on surveys of 110 buildings in Singapore. The surveyed results significantly enhance the interpretability of data-driven FDD methods for M&E services, potentially enhance the FDD performance in terms of accuracy and promote the data-driven FDD approaches to real-world facility management practices.","","Yan, K (Corresponding Author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Built Environm, Singapore 117566, Singapore.

In this paper, the authors propose a novel fuzzy logic-based method to incorporate ethics within smart things of IoT. Ethical considerations relevant to a machine context are represented in terms of fuzzy ethics variables (FEVs) and ethics rules. For each ethics rule, a value called scaled ethics value (SEV) is used to indicate its ethical desirability. In order to model flexibility in ethical response, the authors employ the concept of ethics modes that selectively allow scenarios depending on the value of SEV. The method offers a viable mechanism for smart devices to imbue ethical sensitivity that can pave the way for a technology society amenable to human ethics.

We present MolTaut, a tool for the rapid generation of favorable states of drug-like molecules in water. MolTaut works by enumerating possible tautomeric states with tautomeric transformation rules, ranking tautomers with their relative internal energies and solvation energies calculated by AI-based models, and generating preferred ionization states according to predicted microscopic pKa. Our test shows that the ranking ability of the AI-based tautomer scoring approach is comparable to the DFT method (wB97X/6-31G*// M062X/6-31G*/SMD) from which the AI models try to learn. We find that the substitution effect on tautomeric equilibrium is well predicted by MolTaut, which is helpful in computer-aided ligand design. The source code of MolTaut is freely available to researchers and can be accessed at https://github.com/xundrug/moltaut. To facilitate the usage of MolTaut by medicinal chemists, we made a free web server, which is available at http://moltaut.xundrug.cn.

In this paper, we consider the XAI-powered design of such an IV-IDS using CAN bus data from a public dataset, named ``Survival''. Novel features are engineered, and a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is trained over the dataset. A visualization-based explanation, ``VisExp'', is created to explain the behavior of the AI-based IV-IDS, which is evaluated by experts in a survey, in relation to a rule-based explanation. Our results show that experts' trust in the AI-based IV-IDS is significantly increased when they are provided with VisExp (more so than the rule-based explanation).

This paper establishes a real time detection algorithm based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in order to detect two main components of the PFAS that are, safety harness and life-line, in addition to a standard safety measure of using a safety helmet. The YOLOv3 algorithm is adopted for a deep learning network used to train the desired model. The model achieved an accuracy rate of 91.26% and around 99% precision. Moreover, the overall recall of the model was 90.2%. The obtained results verify the effectiveness of our proposed model in construction sites to control potential violations and to avoid unnecessary accidents. The main contribution of this paper is to provide an AI-based image detection framework to mitigate the likelihood of fall-from-height accidents.","Safety; Artificial intelligence; Accidents; Injuries; Regulation; Inspection; Head; Accidents; CNN; detection; fall from heights; PFAS; YOLOv3","Cho, CS (Corresponding Author), Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Infrastruct & Environm Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.

Recently, a number of protocols are proposed for open communication. However, securing such communications and establishing trust value among vehicles are major addressable issues. This is because the existing fraudulent peers can lead to catastrophic circumstances on roads. Along with securing the data carriers, the authenticity and reliability of data is also equally important. In order to identify reliable nodes and maintaining the authenticity of data being communicated, a new artificial intelligence (AI)-based hybrid trust management framework is proposed in this article. The study particularly exploits the proximity-based k-nearest neighbour (kNN) classification model for selecting controlling nodes. Further, decision stump is employed to accomplish trust estimation rules, and backpropagation is used to self-train the mobile nodes, whenever anticipated trust value is not attained. The proposed scheme maintains the integrity of vehicular nodes and efficiently handles the specified. The trust framework uses a multifaceted direct and recommended trust estimation approach to calculate the global trust values.

Prior to the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based solutions, it was solved in the 1970s by optimization-based strategies. However, AI-based solutions appeared in the 1980s in a pioneering way, by using a Learning Automaton (LA)-motivated strategy known as the so-called Object Migrating Automaton (OMA). Although the OMA and its derivatives have been used in numerous applications since then, the basic kernel has remained the same. Because the number of possible partitions in a partitioning problem can be combinatorially exponential and the underlying tasks are NP-hard, the most advanced OMA algorithms could, until recently, only solve issues involving equally sized groups. Due to our recent innovations cited in the body of this paper, the enhanced OMA now also handles non-equally sized groups. Earlier, we had presented in Omslandseter (Pattern Anal Appl, 2023), a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art enhancements of the best-known OMA. We believe that these results will be the benchmark for a few decades and that it will be very hard to beat these results. This is a companion paper, intended to augment the contents of Omslandseter (Pattern Anal Appl, 2023). In this paper, we first discuss the OMA's prior applications, its historical and current innovations, and the OMA-based algorithms' relevance to societal needs.

Past systematic reviews had reviewed the accuracy of artificial neural networks (ANN) on Electrocardiogram (ECG) readings but that of other AI models on other Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) detection tools remains unclear. Methods: Nine electronic databases were searched from 2012 to 31 August 2022 including grey literature search and hand searching of references of included articles. Risk of bias was assessed by two independent reviewers using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). Test characteristics namely true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives were extracted from all included articles into a 2x2 table. Study-specific estimates of sensitivity and specificity were pooled using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model and displayed using a forest plot and HSROC curve. Results: 66 studies were included in the review. A total of 518,931 patients were included whose mean ages varied from 32.62 to 70 years old. In 66 studies, the sensitivity and specificity of AI-based detection for ACS screening ranged from 64 % to 100 % and 65 %-100 %, respectively. The overall quality of evidence was low due to the inclusion of case-control studies. Conclusion: Results of the study inform the potential of using AI-assisted ACS detection for accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment for ACS. Adherence to the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) guideline and having more cohort studies for future Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) studies are necessary to improve the quality of evidence of AI-based detection of ACS.","Systematic review; Meta-analysis; Diagnostic accuracy; Acute coronary syndrome; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning","Chew, HSJ (Corresponding Author), 10 Med Dr, Singapore 117597, Singapore.

A good solution lies on clinical decision support systems, based on big data analysis. As the processing of large amounts of information gains relevance, automatic approaches become increasingly capable to see and correlate information further and better than the human mind can. In this context, healthcare professionals are increasingly counting on a new set of tools in order to deal with the growing information that becomes available to them on a daily basis. By allowing the grouping of collective knowledge and prioritizing ``mindlines'' against ``guidelines'', these support systems are among the most promising applications of big data in health.

The AI on the ground is triggered by other animals when they enter a radius area with a certain speed defined in the software. It then decides how to behave according to health, behavior type and confidence level. Also, there is non-AI sparrow herd placed over the island to make user understand how fast he is and give the user sense of speed what can be called as an in-project feature.

It is obvious that physical traffic police-based monitoring alone is insufficient to monitor such large traffic volumes and simultaneously track violations. This has led to many violators going unnoticed. The violators, in turn, cause more serious mishaps on the road resulting in danger to their own life as well as to other's life. Thus, there is a need for incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based techniques to eliminate manual intervention for the detection and catching of violators. In this paper, we propose a system to automatically detect two-wheeler violations like not wearing a helmet, usage of a phone while riding, triple riding, wheeling, and illegal parking for Indian road scenarios and eventually automating the ticketing process by capturing the violations and corresponding vehicle number in a database. We propose using a custom trained Yolo-v4 + DeepSORT for detection and tracking and Yolo-v4 + Tesseract for number plate detection and extraction. This implementation obtained a mean average precision (mAP) of 98.09% for violation detection and an accuracy of 99.41% for number plate detection on the test data. Further, the system detected 77 out of 93 violations with zero false positives in real-life scenarios. Thus,showing that the traffic violation system developed can be used to automate traffic violation ticketing. The developed system would be particularly useful in deriving various safety-related policies and will help to enforce strong regulation of traffic rules and build towards a smart city ecosystem via the automated AI-based traffic violation and ticketing system.","Artificial intelligence (AI); detection; smart city; traffic violation","Dubey, RK (Corresponding Author), Robert Bosch Engn & Business Solut Private Ltd, Bengaluru 560095, Karnataka, India.

Raman spectroscopy-based detectors are widely used but have many limitations. The Raman spectrum changes unpredictably due to various environmental factors, and it is hard for detectors to make appropriate judgments about new chemical substances without prior information. Thus, the existing detectors with inflexible techniques based on determined rules cannot deal with such problems flexibly and reactively. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based detection techniques can be good alternatives to the existing techniques for chemical agent detection. To build AI-based detection systems, sufficient amounts of data for training are required, but it is not easy to produce and handle fatal chemical agents, which causes difficulty in securing data in advance. To overcome the limitations, in this paper, we propose the distributed Raman spectrum data augmentation system that leverages federated learning (FL) with deep generative models, such as generative adversarial network (GAN) and autoencoder. Furthermore, the proposed system utilizes various additional techniques in combination to generate a large number of Raman spectrum data with reality along with diversity. We implemented the proposed system and conducted diverse experiments to evaluate the system. The evaluation results validated that the proposed system can train the models more quickly through cooperation among decentralized troops without exchanging raw data and generate realistic Raman spectrum data well.

OCMR handles complex tasks like non-canonical drawing and atomic group abbreviation and substantially improves the current state-of-the-art results on multiple public benchmark datasets and one internally curated dataset.","Bioinformatics; OCSR; Chemical informatics; Chemical structure recognition; Molecular graph; OCMR","Li, KW; Zhou, FF (Corresponding Author), Jilin Univ, Key Lab Symbol Computat & Knowledge Engn, Minist Educ, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China.

Introducing AI technologies, where explainability and trustworthiness are focus items for both government guidelines and responsible technologists, imposes additional challenges. Understanding enough of the technology to be able to make an informed decision, or consent, is essential but involves an acceptance of uncertain outcomes. Further, the contribution of AI-enabled technologies not least during the COVID-19 pandemic raises ethical concerns about the governance associated with their development and deployment. Using three typical scenarios-contact tracing, big data analytics and research during public emergencies-this paper explores a trust-based alternative to consent. Unlike existing consent-based mechanisms, this approach sees consent as a typical behavioural response to perceived contextual characteristics. Decisions to engage derive from the assumption that all relevant stakeholders including research participants will negotiate on an ongoing basis. Accepting dynamic negotiation between the main stakeholders as proposed here introduces a specifically socio-psychological perspective into the debate about human responses to artificial intelligence. This trust-based consent process leads to a set of recommendations for the ethical use of advanced technologies as well as for the ethical review of applied research projects.","informed consent; terms of use; AI-technologies; technology acceptance; trust; public health emergency; COVID-19; big data; contact tracing; research ethics","Pickering, B (Corresponding Author), Univ Southampton, It Innovat Elect & Comp, Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.

A trading system is based on technical indicators derived from technical analysis. In our work, a complete trading system with a combination of trading rules on Forex time series data is developed and made available to the scientific community. The system is implemented in two phases: In the first phase, each trading rule, both the AI-based rule and the trading rules from the technical indicators, is tested for selection; in the second phase, profitable rules are selected among the qualified rules and combined. Training data is used in the training phase of the trading system. The proposed trading system was extensively trained and tested on historical data from 2010 to 2021. To determine the effectiveness of the proposed method, we also conducted experiments with datasets and methodologies used in recent work by Hernandez-Aguila et al., 2021 and by Munkhdalai et al., 2019.

However, tourists need help bringing personal interest and high-value data from the plethora of tourism information. The rise of artificial intelligence has transformed traditional tourism into an intelligent, data-driven industry. This shift has generated vast tourism data, offering both opportunities and challenges. The paper discusses an AI and IoT-based Intelligent Tourism Recommendation System (ITRS) that offers travelers predefined itineraries, personalized suggestions, and tourism insights. This system simplifies attraction discovery, unveiling hidden value within tourism data at the intersection of AI and IoT. The present study thoroughly investigates AI-based recommendation algorithms before delving into the system's architecture. It categorizes user-based, project-based, and article-based collaborative filtering methodologies tailored to specific goals. First, thoroughly examine AI-based recommendation algorithms before delving into the system architecture. Second, categorize collaborative filtering methods as user-based, project-based, and article-based, each tailored to specific objectives. Third, delve into the Apriori algorithm's complexity within the context of weighted association rules and introduce an enhanced iteration for improved efficiency. The proposed scheme encompasses an elaborate ITRS plan featuring a user interest model and a client module, crucial for the computation and analysis of users' long-term and short-term interests. Rigorous performance testing confirms the ITRS's superiority across varying support levels, with experimental results demonstrating the Apriori algorithm's exceptional accuracy, achieving a 94.3% improvement over other methods. The Apriori algorithm is better than traditional recommendation algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, K-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost.","Internet; Artificial intelligence; Intelligent tourism recommendation system; Apriori algorithm","He, YW (Corresponding Author), Beijing Guantao Zhongmao Wuhan Law Firm, Wuhan 430062, Hubei, Peoples R China.

However, due to the uncertain disruptions (e.g., task arrival time, service breakdown duration) of manufacturing processes, how to respond to various dynamics in manufacturing to keep the scheduling process moving forward smoothly and efficiently is becoming a major challenge in dynamic manufacturing scheduling. To solve such a problem, a wide spectrum of artificial intelligence techniques have been developed to (1) accurately construct dynamic scheduling models that can represent both personalized customer needs and uncertain provider capabilities and (2) efficiently obtain a qualified schedule within a limited time. From these two perspectives, this article systemically makes a state-of-the-art literature survey on the application of these artificial intelligence techniques in dynamic manufacturing modeling and scheduling. It first introduces two types of dynamic scheduling problems that consider service- and task-related disruptions in the manufacturing process, respectively, followed by a bibliometric analysis of artificial intelligence techniques for dynamic manufacturing scheduling. Next, various kinds of artificial-intelligence-enabled schedulers for solving dynamic scheduling problems including both directed heuristics and autonomous learning methods are reviewed, which strive not only to quickly obtain optimized solutions but also to effectively achieve the adaption to dynamics. Finally, this article further elaborates on the future opportunities and challenges of using artificial-intelligence-enabled schedulers to solve complex dynamic scheduling problems. In summary, this survey aims to present a thorough and organized overview of artificial-intelligence-enabled dynamic manufacturing scheduling and shed light on some related research directions that are worth studying in the future.","Artificial intelligence; dynamic scheduling; directed heuristic; autonomous learning; manufacturing system","Chen, MS (Corresponding Author), East China Normal Univ, MoE Engn Res Ctr Software, Hardware Codesign Technol & Applicat, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

Methods: In this framework we propose a classification method based on a Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) approach, which allows for the automatic identification of the presence of the disease, and concurrently, provides the explicit classification model used by the system. Results: The proposed approach has been evaluated on the publicly available HandPD dataset, which contains handwriting samples drawn by Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls. We show that our approach compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods, and more importantly, allows the physician to identify an explicit model relevant for the diagnosis based on the most informative subset of features.

Paradoxically, IoT technologies and paradigms such as edge computing, although they have a huge potential for the digital transition towards sustainability, they are not yet contributing to the sustainable development of the IoT sector itself. In fact, such a sector has a significant carbon footprint due to the use of scarce raw materials and its energy consumption in manufacturing, operating, and recycling processes. To tackle these issues, the Green IoT (G-IoT) paradigm has emerged as a research area to reduce such carbon footprint; however, its sustainable vision collides directly with the advent of Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI), which imposes the consumption of additional energy. This article deals with this problem by exploring the different aspects that impact the design and development of Edge-AI G-IoT systems. Moreover, it presents a practical Industry 5.0 use case that illustrates the different concepts analyzed throughout the article. Specifically, the proposed scenario consists in an Industry 5.0 smart workshop that looks for improving operator safety and operation tracking. Such an application case makes use of a mist computing architecture composed of AI-enabled IoT nodes. After describing the application case, it is evaluated its energy consumption and it is analyzed the impact on the carbon footprint that it may have on different countries.

Ambiguity and incompleteness due to missing values in output and input attributes, respectively, is ubiquitous in these domains. It could have an adverse impact on a certain unrepresented set of people in the training data without a developer's intention to discriminate. The inherently nonnumerical nature of categorical attributes than numerical attributes and the presence of incomplete and ambiguous categorical attributes in a dataset increases the uncertainty in decision-making. This paper addresses the challenges in handling categorical attributes as it is not addressed comprehensively in previous research. Three sources of uncertainties in categorical attributes are recognised in this research. The informational uncertainty, unforeseeable uncertainty in the decision task environment, and the uncertainty due to lack of premodelling explainability in categorical attributes are addressed in the proposed methodology on maximum likelihood evidential reasoning (MAKER). It can transform and impute incomplete and ambiguous categorical attributes into interpretable numerical features. It utilises a notion of weight and reliability to include subjective expert preference over a piece of evidence and the quality of evidence in a categorical attribute, respectively. The MAKER framework strives to integrate the recognised uncertainties in the transformed input data that allow a model to perceive data limitations during the training regime and acknowledge doubtful predictions by supporting trustworthy pre-modelling and post modelling explainability. The ability to handle uncertainty and its impact on explainability is demonstrated on a real-world healthcare and finance data for different missing data scenarios in three types of AI algorithms: deep-learning, tree-based, and rule-based model.","Categorical; Uncertainty; Decision-making; Evidential reasoning; Trustworthy","Sachan, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Manchester, Decis & Cognit Sci Res Ctr DCSRC, Booth St West, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.

The core ethical decision-making capacity of an AI based on the pluralist hybrid approach consists of two systems. The first is a deterministic algorithm system that embraces different moral rules for making explicit moral decisions. The second is a machine learning system that accounts for calculating the value of the variables required by the application of moral principles. The pluralist hybrid system is better than the existing proposals as it better addresses the moral disagreement problem of the top-down approach by including distinct moral principles.

The spectral images in different bands were acquired using a self-made portable light-emitting diode (LED)-induced autofluorescence multispectral imager equipped with 365 and 405 nm excitation LEDs, emission filters with center wavelengths of 470, 505, 525, 532, 550, 595, 632, 635, and 695 nm, and a color image sensor. The spectral images of 218 healthy points in 62 healthy participants and 218 tumor points in 62 patients were collected in the ex vivo trials at China Medical University Hospital. These ex vivo trials were similar to in vivo because the spectral images of anatomical specimens were immediately acquired after the on-site tumor resection. The spectral images associated with red, blue, and green filters correlated with and without nine emission filters were quantized by four computing method, including summated intensity, the highest number of the intensity level, entropy, and fractional dimension. The combination of four computing methods, two excitation light sources with two intensities, and 30 spectral bands in three experiments formed 264 classifiers. The quantized data in each classifier was divided into two groups: one was the training group optimizing the threshold of the quantized data, and the other was validating group tested under this optimized threshold. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of each classifier were derived from these tests. To identify the influential spectral bands based on the area under the region and the testing results, a single-layer network learning process was used. This was compared to conventional rules-based approaches to show its superior and faster performance. Consequently, four emission filters with the center wavelengths of 470, 505, 532, and 550 nm were selected by an AI-based method and verified using a rule-based approach. The sensitivities of six classifiers using these emission filters were more significant than 90%. The average sensitivity of these was about 96.15%, the average specificity was approximately 69.55%, and the average accuracy was about 82.85%.","AI-based band selection; rule-based band selection; oral squamous cell carcinoma; LED induced autofluorescence; multispectral imager","Ou-Yang, M (Corresponding Author), Natl Yang Ming Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Elect & Control Engn, 1001 Univ Rd, Hsinchu 30010, Taiwan.

A fundamental aspect of humane working conditions is the ability to exert influence over different aspects of one's own work. Consequently, stakeholders contribute to the prospect of maintaining the workers' autonomy albeit increasing automation and summarize this aspiration with the human in control principle. Job control has been part of multiple theories and models within the field of occupational psychology. However, most of the models do not include specific technical considerations nor focus on task but rather on job level. That is, they are possibly not able to fully explain specific changes regarding the digitalization of tasks. According to the results of a large-scale study on German workers (DiWaBe), this seems to be the case to some extend: the influence of varying degrees of automation, moderated by perceived autonomy, on workers' wellbeing was not consistent. However, automation is a double-edged sword: on a high level, it can be reversely related to the workers' job control while highly autonomous and reliable systems can also create opportunities for more flexible, impactful and diverse working tasks. Consequently, automation can foster and decrease the factor of job control. Models about the optimal level of automation aim to give guidelines on how the former can be achieved. The results of the DiWaBe study indicate that automation in occupational practice does not always happen in line with these models. Instead, a substantial part of automation happens at the decision-making level, while executive actions remain with the human. From an occupational safety and health perspective, it is therefore crucial to closely monitor and anticipate the implementation of AI in working systems. Constellations where employees are too controlled by technology and are left with a high degree of demands and very limited resources should be avoided. Instead, it would be favorable to use AI as an assistance tool for the employees, helping them to gather and process information and assisting them in decision-making.","human in control; AI-based systems; occupational safety and health (OSH); human factors; robotic systems; ICT","Wischniewski, S (Corresponding Author), Fed Inst Occupat Hlth & Safety BAuA, Unit Human Factors, Ergon, Dortmund, Germany.

We address the spatial exploration problem in two levels on the whole. On the higher level, a DRL based global module learns to determine a distant but easily reachable target that maximizes the current exploration progress. On the lower level, another two-level hierarchical movement controller is used to produce locally smooth and safe movements between targets based on the information of known areas and free space assumption. Experimental results on diverse and challenging 2D dynamic maps show that the proposed model achieves almost 90% coverage and generates smoother trajectories compared with a state-of-the-art IM based DRL and some other heuristic methods on the basis of avoiding obstacles in real time.","spatial exploration; hierarchical framework; deep reinforcement learning; intrinsic motivation; path planning; obstacle avoidance","Hu, Y (Corresponding Author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Syst Engn, Changsha 410003, Peoples R China.

This letter presents a protocol for creating hyperlipemic plasma samples and proposes the use of a microspectrometer-based BLD sensor to collect the spectra. Furthermore, to address the false alarm problem (blood rate >= 0.7%), we developed a first approach using thresholding and linear support vector machine (SVM). In addition, to improve data classification performance, three artificial neural networks (ANNs) were developed with different classification tasks, then applied to four different databases.

Nowadays, the number of IoT devices is already higher than the world population. These devices operate by exchanging data between them, sometimes through an intermediate cloud infrastructure, and may be used to enable a wide variety of novel services that can potentially improve the quality of life of billions of people. Nonetheless, all that glitters is not gold: the increasing adoption of IoT comes with several privacy concerns due to the lack or loss of control over the sensitive data exchanged by these devices. This represents a key challenge for software engineering researchers attempting to address those privacy concerns by proposing (semi-)automated solutions to identify sources of privacy leaks. In this respect, a notable trend is represented by the adoption of smart solutions, that is, the definition of techniques based on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. This paper proposes a systematic literature review of the research in smart detection of privacy concerns in IoT devices. Following well-established guidelines, we identify 152 primary studies that we analyze under three main perspectives: (1) What are the privacy concerns addressed with AI-enabled techniques; (2) What are the algorithms employed and how they have been configured/validated; and (3) Which are the domains targeted by these techniques. The key results of the study identified six main tasks targeted through the use of artificial intelligence, like Malware Detection or Network Analysis. Support Vector Machine is the technique most frequently used in literature, however in many cases researchers do not explicitly indicate the domain where to use artificial intelligence algorithms. We conclude the paper by distilling several lessons learned and implications for software engineering researchers.

This work proposes an explainable AI (XAI) approach on the quarterly available fundamental data of companies traded on the German stock market. In the XAI, distance-based structures in data (DSD) that guide decision tree induction are identified. The leaves of the appropriately selected decision tree contain subsets of stocks and provide viable explanations that can be rated by a human. The prediction of the future price trends of specific stocks is made possible using the explanations and a rating. In each quarter, stock picking by DSD-XAI is based on understanding the explanations and has a higher success rate than arbitrary stock picking, a hybrid AI system, and a recent unsupervised decision tree called eUD3.5.","decision trees; explainable AI; fundamental analysis; information visualization","Thrun, MC (Corresponding Author), Philipps Univ Marburg, Fac Math & Comp Sci, Hans Meerwein Str, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.

In this study, students' teamwork skills were assessed independently by a computer algorithm and two human experts based on the transcripts of their conversations with ``teammates'' (chatbots). The relative accuracy of these assessments was evaluated against peer- and self-evaluations of teamwork. The assessment scores generated by the algorithm and human experts were highly correlated with each other and were comparable in their ability to predict teamwork. The scores generated by the algorithm were slightly more correlated with peer-evaluations than those generated by human experts (r = .25 and r = .17, respectively; p = .21).

These techniques are implementable with little domain knowledge. This, combined with the difficulty of testing AI systems with traditional methods, has made system trustworthiness a pressing issue. Objective: This paper studies the methods used to validate practical AI systems reported in the literature. Our goal is to classify and describe the methods that are used in realistic settings to ensure the dependability of AI systems. Method: A systematic literature review resulted in 90 papers. Systems presented in the papers were analysed based on their domain, task, complexity, and applied validation methods. Results: The validation methods were synthesized into a taxonomy consisting of trial, simulation, model-centred validation, and expert opinion. Failure monitors, safety channels, redundancy, voting, and input and output restrictions are methods used to continuously validate the systems after deployment. Conclusions: Our results clarify existing strategies applied to validation. They form a basis for the synthesization, assessment, and refinement of AI system validation in research and guidelines for validating individual systems in practice.

The result shows that terminologies used to describe ADAS functions vary widely across manufacturers and sometimes do not reflect their fundamental functions intuitively. Operational conditions and control procedures also vary across the selected models under this study. Due to this lack of consensus across the industry, drivers are not aware or well informed about ADAS functions in their vehicles, leading to a very low utilization rate and may lead to misuse of those functions. This paper provides insightful suggestions for the transport industry, Artificial Intelligence (AI) experts, and regulators to design frameworks and guidelines in governing the naming convention, operating conditions, control procedures, and information disclosure of ADAS. Such guidelines can be the foundations for regulating future AI-based self-driving functions.","ADAS; Autonomous vehicles; Operating conditions; Regulation; Standards; Transparency","Murtaza, M (Corresponding Author), RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.

In particular, multiobjective optimization (MOO) is necessary in resolving the competition among different nodes sharing limited wireless network resources. A unified coordination mechanism is essential such that individual nodes conduct the opportunistic maximization of heterogeneous local objectives for efficient distributed resource allocation. To such a problem, this article proposes an artificial intelligence (AI)-based framework, which is termed as MOO strategy for AI-aided IoT communications (MOSAIC). This framework enables to tackle numerous MOO tasks in IoT network management with simple reconfiguration of learning rules. In this strategy, a component unit associated with an individual network node includes a pair of deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn optimal local functions responsible for calculation and distributed coordination, respectively. The resultant AI module swarm called DNN tiles realizes the node cooperation that collectively seeks distributed MOO calculation rules. The advantage of MOSAIC is characterized by Pareto tradeoffs among conflicting performance metrics in diverse wireless networking configurations subject to severe interference and distinct criteria for multiple targets.","Deep learning (DL); distributed network management; multiobjective optimization; primal-dual training","Lee, SH (Corresponding Author), Korea Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea.

An artificial intelligence-based power reference correction (AI-PRC) module is developed for GFLIs to autonomously adjust their power setpoints during transient disturbances. A detailed analytical validation is provided that shows control rules in PEDG intrinsically follow the underlying dynamic of the swing-based machines to extend its stability boundary. Considering this fact, comprehensive transient and steady state-based mathematical models are used for constructing the learning database of the proposed AI-PRC. The proposed training approach can deal with grid's characteristics alterations and uncertainties. Thus, this approach incorporates PEDG's effective variables that shapes its dynamic response during transient disturbances. Subsequently, a neural network is trained by Bayesian regularization algorithm to realize the proposed AI-PRC scheme for frequency support via GFLIs.

The present work introduces a novel ensemble decision model which utilizes an explainable and fast-growing rule-based system, called extended belief rule base (EBRB) decision model, to alleviate the impact of class imbalance, where the proposed ensemble EBRB model includes two core components: a diversity-based base EBRB construction scheme and a consistency-based ensemble EBRB inference scheme. Specifically, for the purpose of enhancing diversity in the construction scheme, various kinds of oversampling techniques are applied to construct diverse base EBRBs firstly, followed by the calculation of attribute weights based on information gain. As for the inference scheme, the proposed ensemble EBRB model aims to produce inferential outputs not only integrating the rules activated from all base EBRBs, but also taking into consideration the consistency of the activated rules. In experimental study, twenty-six imbalanced classification datasets are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ensemble EBRB decision model. Results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms conventional EBRB systems and other typical imbalanced classifiers. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately, the AI models are opaque in nature, and there are no certification accepted rules for CV & AI-enhanced functionality certification. Capturing and labeling camera image in real environment is expensive in terms of time and resources and it does not guarantee enough variation in edge visibility conditions, which makes the resulting database less valuable for the validation and verification (V & V) processes.

Then, the applicability of such modelling is illustrated on the example of a fusion-based media forensic investigation pipeline aimed at the detection of DeepFake videos using five exemplary detectors (hand-crafted, in one case neural network supported) and testing two different fusion operators.

Inspired by the latest breakthroughs of AI and its power to address large-scale and complex difficulties, the network community has begun to consider shifting the NTC paradigm from legacy rule-based to novel AI-based. As an applied inter-discipline, design and implementation are important. Although there have been some preliminary explorations along this frontier, they are either limited by only envisioning the prospects, or too scattered to provide high-level insight into a general methodology. To this end, we start with the domain knowledge relationships of AI and NTC, summarizing a baseline workflow toward deep reinforcement learning, which will be the dominant method for the AI-NTC paradigm. On top of that, we argue that AI-NTC training and running must be carried out in online environments in closed-loop fashion for the purpose of putting ti into practice. A series of challenges and opportunities are discussed from a realistic viewpoint, and a set of new architecture and mechanism to enable the online and closed-loop AI-NTC paradigm are proposed.

However, most studies aim to improve performance, and performance-oriented systems tend to be composed of black box models, whose internal working is complex. In the field of security control, analysts strive for interpretation and response based on information from given data, system prediction results, and knowledge. Consequently, performance-oriented systems suffer from a lack of interpretability owing to the lack of system prediction results and internal process information. The recent social climate also demands a responsible system rather than a performance-focused one. This research aims to ensure understanding and interpretation by providing interpretability for AI systems in multiple classification environments that can detect various attacks. In particular, the better the performance, the more complex and less transparent the model and the more limited the area that the analyst can understand, the lower the processing efficiency accordingly.

Classical encryption techniques have been employed to ensure the data security of the IoT network. However, high-level encryption techniques cannot be employed in IoT devices due to the limitation of resources. In addition, node security is still a challenge for network engineers.

PRISMA guidelines had been used to select the articles published on the web of science, EBSCO, and EMBASE between 2009 and 2021. In this study, we performed an efficient search and included the research articles that employed AI-based learning approaches for cancer prediction. A total of 185 papers are considered impactful for cancer prediction using conventional machine and deep learning-based classifications. In addition, the survey also deliberated the work done by the different researchers and highlighted the limitations of the existing literature, and performed the comparison using various parameters such as prediction rate, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, dice score, detection rate, area undercover, precision, recall, and F1-score. Five investigations have been designed, and solutions to those were explored. Although multiple techniques recommended in the literature have achieved great prediction results, still cancer mortality has not been reduced. Thus, more extensive research to deal with the challenges in the area of cancer prediction is required.","","Kumar, Y (Corresponding Author), Indus Univ, Indus Inst Technol Sr Engn, Dept Comp Engn, Ahmadabad 382115, Gujarat, India.

Planning therapy merely depends on precisely detecting and quantitatively classifying ascites to minimize potential adverse effects. However, manually segmenting and quantifying ascites is time-consuming asascites typically appear on multiple CT scans. In this study, an AI-based approach (SRFLab) is developed to quantify ascites from CT scans automatically. First, abdomen sections are automatically acquired from the retrospectively screened CT volume using multitask classification (AcquNet). The proposed CNN is retrieved under a task-specific objective using transfer learning. Alternatively, ascites are learned from a supervision representation fusion CNN (QuanNet) to evaluate fluid formation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed schema leads to good performance compared to other existing methods. AcquNet achieved a mean accuracy of 97.80% +/- and a 1.97% standard deviation, while the accuracy of QuanNet achieved a mean accuracy of 97.21% +/- and a 2.61% standard deviation. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate the effec-tiveness of the proposed model and the advancement of the volumetric assessment of ascites on CT volume images. The proposed model is more efficient at detecting and quantifying ascites in patients than clinical experts. Thus, the proposed model can support the rapid grading of ascites on CT volume images and aid radiologists in clinical practice.","","Zhang, J (Corresponding Author), Cent South Univ, Xiangya Hosp 2, Gastroenterol Dept, Changsha 410011, Peoples R China.

The paper presents specific guidelines for the ethical use and development of this technology, including recommendations for data privacy, bias mitigation, and user control. By implementing these guidelines, the potential benefits of VAs powered by LLMs can be fully realized while minimizing the risks of harm and ensuring that ethical considerations are at the forefront of the development process.","ethical challenges; virtual assistants; Large Language Models; ethical AI; ethical guidelines; data privacy; bias mitigation; public services; AI regulation","Piñeiro-Martín, A (Corresponding Author), Balidea Consulting & Programming SL, Witland Bldg,Caminos Vida St, Santiago De Compostela 15701, Spain.

For instance, it is used locally, as part of a sensor system, on the edge for low-latency high-performance inference, or in the cloud, e.g. for data mining. Modern complex systems, such as connected vehicles, are often part of an Internet of Things (IoT). This poses additional architectural challenges. To manage complexity, architectures are described with architecture frameworks, which are composed of a number of architectural views connected through correspondence rules. Despite some attempts, the definition of a mathematical foundation for architecture frameworks that are suitable for the development of distributed AI systems still requires investigation and study. In this paper, we propose to extend the state of the art on architecture framework by providing a mathematical model for system architectures, which is scalable and supports co-evolution of different aspects for example of an AI system. Based on Design Science Research, this study starts by identifying the challenges with architectural frameworks in a use case of distributed AI systems. Then, we derive from the identified challenges four rules, and we formulate them by exploiting concepts from category theory. We show how compositional thinking can provide rules for the creation and management of architectural frameworks for complex systems, for example distributed systems with AI. The aim of the paper is not to provide viewpoints or architecture models specific to AI systems, but instead to provide guidelines based on a mathematical formulation on how a consistent framework can be built up with existing, or newly created, viewpoints. To put in practice and test the approach, the identified and formulated rules are applied to derive an architectural framework for the EU Horizon 2020 project ``Very efficient deep learning in the IoT'' (VEDLIoT) in the form of a case study.

However, despite the success of AI in different areas, the problem of designing AI systems that can truly mimic human cognitive capabilities such as artificial general intelligence, remains largely open. Consequently, many emerging cross-device AI applications will require a transition from traditional centralized learning systems towards large-scale distributed AI systems that can collaboratively perform multiple complex learning tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel design philosophy called democratized learning (Dem-AI) whose goal is to build large-scale distributed learning systems that rely on the self-organization of distributed learning agents that are wellconnected, but limited in learning capabilities. Correspondingly, inspired by the societal groups of humans, the specialized groups of learning agents in the proposed Dem-AI system are selforganized in a hierarchical structure to collectively perform learning tasks more efficiently. As such, the Dem-AI learning system can evolve and regulate itself based on the underlying duality of two processes which we call specialized and generalized processes. In this regard, we present a reference design as a guideline to realize future Dem-AI systems, inspired by various interdisciplinary fields. Accordingly, we introduce four underlying mechanisms in the design such as plasticity-stability transition mechanism, self-organizing hierarchical structuring, specialized learning, and generalization. Finally, we establish possible extensions and new challenges for the existing learning approaches to provide better scalable, flexible, and more powerful learning systems with the new setting of Dem-AI.","Learning systems; Task analysis; Guidelines","Hong, CS (Corresponding Author), Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea.

Apart from other services, contact tracing has been extensively performed with the help of Bluetooth and GPS-powered smartphone applications when vaccines were unavailable. In this article, we technically analyze the contact tracing platform developed by Google-Apple for constraining the spread of COVID-19. We suggest unexplored technical functionalities that can further strengthen the platform from privacy preservation, service scenarios, and robustness point of view. Lastly, some AI-based and privacy-assured services that can be integrated with the platform to control the pandemic adequately are suggested. The technical analysis demonstrates that while the Google-Apple platform is well-engineered, it is not free of vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and misconfigurations that may lead to its poor adoption in real-life scenarios.

Not only did the bibliometric analysis identify the most influential authors, countries, institutions, sources, and documents, but it also recognized four ethical concerns associated with 12 medical issues. These ethical categories are composed of normative, meta-ethics, epistemological and medical practice. The content analysis complemented this list of ethical categories and distinguished seven more ethical categories: ethics of relationships, medico-legal concerns, ethics of robots, ethics of ambient intelligence, patients' rights, physicians' rights, and ethics of predictive analytics. This analysis likewise identified 40 general research gaps in the literature and plausible future research strands. This analysis furthers conversations on the ethics of AI and associated emerging technologies such as nanotech and biotech in healthcare, hence, advances convergence research on the ethics of AI in healthcare.

To address these challenges, the integration of AI-based methods for automated violation detection is increasingly vital, reducing the need for manual oversight. Low-light conditions pose additional difficulties, as violations become harder to detect. In this study, we created a novel dataset containing 1032 images with 1475 two-wheeler violations under low-light conditions. We propose a real-time deep learning system using YOLO-v8 for two-wheeler violation detection. Our system addresses the challenge of low-light conditions by incorporating a real-time low-light video enhancement module.

In traditional systems, self-tuning database systems are commonly addressed with heuristics to suggest the physical structures (e.g., creation of indexes and materialized views) that enable the fastest execution of queries. However, existing designer tools do not explain/justify how the system behaves and the reasoning behind tuning activities. Moreover, these tools do not keep the database administrator (DBA) in the loop of the optimization process to trust some of the automatic tuning decisions. To address this problem, we introduce a framework called Explain-Tun that enables to predict and explain self-tuning actions with transparent strategy from historical data using two explicit models, that is, decision tree and random forests. First, we propose AI-based DBMS to explain how to select physical structures and provide decision rules extracted by machine learning (ML) as a designed plug-gable component. Second, a goal-oriented model to keep DBA in the loop of the optimization process in order to manipulate ML models as CRUD entities.

Cognitive, behavior and affective adaptation means are included in developing a dynamic learner model, which detects and corrects each student's learning style and cognitive level. As adaptation targets, the platform provides adaptive content presentation in two groups (VARK and gamification), adaptive exercises navigation and adaptive feedback. To achieve its goal, the platform utilizes a Deep Q-Network Reinforcement Learning (DQN-RL) and an online rule-based decision making implementation. The platform interfaces front-end dedicated website and back-end adaptation algorithms. An improvement in learning effectiveness is achieved comparing the post-test to the pre-test in a pilot experiment for grade 3 mathematics curriculum. Both groups witnessed academic performance and satisfaction level improvements, most importantly, for the students who started the experiment with a relatively low performance. VARK group witnessed a slightly more improvement and higher satisfaction level, since interactive activities and games in the kinesthetic presentation can provide engagement, while keeping other presentation styles available, when needed.","Dynamic learner model; Gamification; Learning style; Primary school mathematics; Reinforcement learning","Sayed, WS (Corresponding Author), Cairo Univ, Fac Engn, Engn Math & Phys Dept, Giza 12613, Egypt.

In the past four decades, many investigations have been conducted on this process, aiming to better understand its nature and improve the surface quality of the products as well as extending tool life. To achieve these goals, it is necessary to form a general descriptive reference model of the milling process using experimental data, thermomechanical analysis, statistical or artificial intelligence (AI) models. Moreover, increasing demands for more efficient milling processes, qualified surface finishing, and modeling techniques have propelled the development of more effective modeling methods and approaches. In this paper, an extensive literature survey of the state-of-the-art modeling techniques of milling processes will be carried out, more specifically of recent advances and applications of AI-based modeling techniques. The comparative study of the available methods as well as the suitability of each method for corresponding types of experiments will be presented. In addition, the weaknesses of each method as well as open research challenges will be presented.

In particular, those used in cold storages can be subject to frosting in the scanner window when they are carried out of the warehouses to a room-temperature space outside. To prevent this, they usually employ a film heater on the scanner window. However, the temperature and humidity conditions of the surrounding environment and the temperature of the terminal itself that cause frosting vary widely. Due to the complicated frost-forming conditions, existing industrial mobile terminals choose to implement rather simple rules that operate the film heater well above the freezing point, which inevitably leads to inefficient energy use. This paper demonstrates that to avoid such waste, on-device artificial intelligence (AI) a.k.a. edge AI can be readily employed to industrial mobile terminals and can improve their energy efficiency. We propose an artificial-intelligence-based approach that utilizes deep learning technology to avoid the energy-wasting defrosting operations. By combining the traditional temperature-sensing logic with a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier that visually checks for frost, we can more precisely control the defrosting operation. We embed the CNN classifier in the device and demonstrate that the approach significantly reduces the energy consumption. On our test terminal, the net ratio of the energy consumption by the existing system to that of the edge AI for the heating film is almost 14:1. Even with the common current-dissipation accounted for, our edge AI system would increase the operating hours by 86%, or by more than 6 h compared with the system without the edge AI.","industrial mobile terminal; scanner window; frost; deep learning; convolutional neural network (CNN); classification; energy saving","Kim, H (Corresponding Author), Korea Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea.

In this article, we present an influence-based nano fuzzy swarm (INFS) for oxygen deficiency detection and therapy using a swarm of oxygen carrier nanomachines operating in three cognitive fields of control, influence, and interest. In particular, we propose a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep neural network for detecting apnea by analyzing the irregular peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) signal. Using the proposed sleep-in-the-loop strategy and the desaturated blood biomarkers, including oxygen and hydrogen ion concentrations, an in-silico multithreshold nano fuzzy swarm noninvasive therapeutic method is then performed. We also analytically prove the stability of the INFS using swarm control theory. We apply our strategy to sleep apnea, as one of the most common instances of oxygen deficiency. Furthermore, we compare the accuracy of INSF by using LSTM, bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and support vector machines (SVM). The detection and therapy results are then compared with other apnea detection methods. The input variables and structure of INSF, i.e., the number of rules and width of membership functions, are studied in terms of robustness to noise. As the results show, the proposed artificial intelligence (AI)-based noninvasive nano detection and therapy method could outperform the competing approaches in treating oxygen deficiency emergencies such as apnea.","Medical treatment; Sleep apnea; Complex systems; Sensors; Feature extraction; Red blood cells; Oxygen; Apnea; complex systems; fuzzy basis functions (FBFs); fuzzy systems; nanonetworks; swarm intelligence","Mohammad, R (Corresponding Author), Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Ctr Excellence Soft Comp & Intelligent Informat P, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Engn, Mashhad 917751111, Iran.

In this rapidly evolving field, large number of methods are being reported using machine learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. Majority of these models are inherently complex and lacks explanations of the decision making process causing these models to be termed as `Black-Box'. One of the major bottlenecks to adopt such models in mission-critical application domains, such as banking, e-commerce, healthcare, and public services and safety, is the difficulty in interpreting them. Due to the rapid proleferation of these AI models, explaining their learning and decision making process are getting harder which require transparency and easy predictability. Aiming to collate the current state-of-the-art in interpreting the black-box models, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the explainable AI (XAI) models. To reduce false negative and false positive outcomes of these back-box models, finding flaws in them is still difficult and inefficient. In this paper, the development of XAI is reviewed meticulously through careful selection and analysis of the current state-of-the-art of XAI research. It also provides a comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of the XAI frameworks and their efficacy to serve as a starting point of XAI for applied and theoretical researchers.

However, for a molecule to be considered a viable drug candidate, it must exhibit certain desirable properties such as low toxicity, high druggability, and synthesizability. To address this, we propose an approach that incorporates prior knowledge about these properties during the model training process. In this study, we utilized the PubChem database, which contains 100 million molecules, to filter drug-like molecules based on the quantity of drug-likeliness (QED) score and the Pfizer rule. We then used this filtered dataset of drug-like molecules to train both molecular representation (ChemBERTa) and molecular generation models (MolGPT). To assess the performance of the molecular representation model, we fine-tuned the results on the MoleculeNet benchmark datasets. Meanwhile, we evaluated the performance of the molecular generation model based on the generated samples comprising 10,000 molecules. Despite the limited diversity of the pre-training dataset, the models for molecular representation were able to retain at least 90% of their original performance on benchmark datasets, with an additional improvement of 6% in predicting clinical toxicology. In the domain of molecular generation, the model pre-trained on drug-like molecules exhibited a high rate of desirable molecule properties in the unconditionally generated outputs. Additionally, the diversity of generated structures demonstrated notable performance compared to the conditional generation approach. Moreover, the drug-like molecule pre-training strategy is not limited to a specific model or training method, making it a flexible approach that can be easily modified based on the research interests and criteria of interest.","AI-based drug discovery; pre-training; quantity of drug-likeliness; Pfizer rule","Myeong, IS; Kim, Y (Corresponding Author), Daegu Catholic Univ, Coll Pharm, Gyongsan 38430, South Korea.

Considering the other side of the coin, the eruption of technology has created situations that need more caution about the safety and security of data and systems at all levels. Thus, to hedge against the growing threats of cybersecurity, the need for a robust AI platform supported by machine learning and other supportive technologies is well recognized by organizations. AI is a much sought-after topic, and there is extolling literature available in repositories. Hence, a systematic arrangement of the literature that can help identify the right AI platform that can provide identity governance and access control is the need of the hour. Having this background, the present study is commissioned a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to accomplish the necessity. Literature related to AI and Identity and Access Management (IAM) is collected from renowned peer-reviewed digital libraries for systematic analysis and assessment purposes using the systematic review guidelines. Thus, the final list of articles relevant to the framed research questions related to the study topic is fetched and is reviewed thoroughly. For the proposed systematic research work, the literature reported during the period ranging from 2016 to 2021 (a portion of 2021 is included) is analyzed and a total of 43 papers were depicted more relevant to the selected research domain. These articles were accumulated from ProQuest, Scopus, Taylor & Franics, Science Direct, and Wiley online repositories. The article's contribution can supplement the AI-based IAM information and steer the entities of diverse sectors concerning seamless implementation.

From healthcare decision-making to social media censoring, these agents face problems, and make decisions with ethical and societal implications. Ethical behaviour is a critical characteristic that we would like in a human-centric AI. A common observation in human-centric industries, like the service industry and healthcare, is that their professionals tend to break rules, if necessary, for pro-social reasons. This behaviour among humans is defined as pro-social rule breaking. To make AI agents more human-centric, we argue that there is a need for a mechanism that helps AI agents identify when to break rules set by their designers. To understand when AI agents need to break rules, we examine the conditions under which humans break rules for pro-social reasons. In this paper, we present a study that introduces a `vaccination strategy dilemma' to human participants and analyzes their response. In this dilemma, one needs to decide whether they would distribute COVID-19 vaccines only to members of a high-risk group (follow the enforced rule) or, in selected cases, administer the vaccine to a few social influencers (break the rule), which might yield an overall greater benefit to society. The results of the empirical study suggest a relationship between stakeholder utilities and pro-social rule breaking (PSRB), which neither deontological nor utilitarian ethics completely explain. Finally, the paper discusses the design characteristics of an ethical agent capable of PSRB and the future research directions on PSRB in the AI realm. We hope that this will inform the design of future AI agents, and their decision-making behaviour.","Machine ethics; Pro-social rule breaking; Pro-social behaviour; Artificial Intelligence","Ramanayake, R (Corresponding Author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Comp Sci, Dublin, Ireland.

Traditional security approaches such as signature-based and rule-based have limited detection capabilities toward new and sophisticated attacks. To address this issue, there has been an increasing focus on implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in cloud security measures. In this research article, we present CADS-ML/DL, an efficient cloud-based multi-attack detection system. We investigate the effectiveness of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques for detecting cloud attacks. Our approach leverages a realistic dataset consisting of both benign and fourteen common attack network flows that meet real-world criteria on the AWS cloud platform. We evaluate eight Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) based on ML and DL algorithms, including Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, and Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models. Experimental results demonstrate that the CADS-ML/DL system, specifically the XGBoost model, outperforms the other models, exhibiting an accuracy of 0.9770 and a false error rate of 0.0230. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed XGBoost model on the AWS benchmark CSE-CICIDS2018 dataset, attaining a remarkable accuracy score of 0.9999 and an exceptionally low false error rate of 0.0001. Our findings suggest that AI-based approaches have the potential to detect cloud attacks effectively and contribute to the development of reliable and efficient IDSs for cloud security.","Cloud computing; CICFlowMeter; Machine learning (ML); Deep learning (DL); Multi-attack detection system; CSE-CICIDS2018","Farhat, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Sfax, ENET COM, NTS COM Res Unit, Sfax, Tunisia.

Asynchronous messaging is increasingly used to support human-machine interactions, generally implemented through chatbots. Such virtual entities assist the users in activities of different kinds (e.g., work, leisure, and health-related) and are becoming ingrained into humans' habits due to factors including (i) the availability of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, (ii) the increasingly engaging nature of chatbot interactions, (iii) the release of dedicated APIs from messaging platforms, and (iv) increasingly complex AI-based mechanisms to power the bots' behaviors. Nevertheless, most of the modern chatbots rely on state machines (implementing conversational rules) and one-fits-all approaches, neglecting personalization, data-stream privacy management, multi-topic management/interconnection, and multimodal interactions. Objective. This work addresses the challenges above through an agent-based framework for chatbot development named EREBOTS. Methods. The foundations of the framework are based on the implementation of (i) multi-front-end connectors and interfaces (i.e., Telegram, dedicated App, and web interface), (ii) enabling the configuration of multi-scenario behaviors (i.e., preventive physical conditioning, smoking cessation, and support for breast-cancer survivors), (iii) online learning, (iv) personalized conversations and recommendations (i.e., mood boost, anti-craving persuasion, and balance-preserving physical exercises), and (v) responsive multi-device monitoring interface (i.e., doctor and admin). Results. EREBOTS has been tested in the context of physical balance preservation in social confinement times (due to the ongoing pandemic). Thirteen individuals characterized by diverse age, gender, and country distribution have actively participated in the experimentation, reporting advancements in the physical balance and overall satisfaction of the interaction and exercises' variety they have been proposed.","chatbot; multi-agent systems; personalized virtual assistant; privacy agents; eHealth; conversational agent","Calvaresi, D; Calbimonte, JP (Corresponding Author), Univ Appl Sci & Arts Western Switzerland HES SO, Inst Informat Syst, CH-2800 Delemont, Switzerland.

Various AI algorithms are embedded in cooperative fog/edge devices to construct medical Internet of Things environments, infectious disease forecast systems, smart health, and so on. However, these systems are usually done in isolation, which is called single-task learning. They do not consider the correlation and relationship between multiple/different tasks, so some common information in the model parameters or data characteristics is lost. In this study, each data center in fog/edge computing is considered as a task in the multi-task learning framework. In such a learning framework, a multi-task weighted Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system, called MW-TSKFS, is developed to forecast the trend of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MW-TSKFS provides a multi-task learning strategy for both antecedent and consequent parameters of fuzzy rules. First, a multi-task weighted fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is developed for antecedent parameter learning, which extracts the public information among all tasks and the private information of each task. By sharing the public cluster centroid and public membership matrix, the differences of commonality and individuality can be further exploited. For consequent parameter learning of MW-TSKFS, a multi-task collaborative learning mechanism is developed based on e-insensitive criterion and L2 norm penalty term, which can enhance the generalization and forecasting ability of the proposed fuzzy system. The experimental results on the real COVID-19 time series show that the forecasting tend model based on multi-task the weighted TSK fuzzy system has a high application value.","Fog/edge computing; multi-tasking learning; TSK fuzzy system; multi-task weighted fuzzy c-means clustering; COVID-19","Gu, XQ (Corresponding Author), Changzhou Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Changzhou, Peoples R China.

Though some developed countries prepared guidelines for evaluation of LBP with tests to detect psychological overlay, implementation of the recommendations becomes quite difficult in regular clinical practice, and different specialties of medicine offer different modes of management. Aiming at offering an expert-level diagnosis for the patients having LBP, this paper uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to derive a clinically justified and highly sensitive LBP resolution technique. Materials and methods: The paper considers exhaustive knowledge for different LBP disorders (classified based on different pain generators), which have been represented using lattice structures to ensure completeness, nonredundancy, and optimality in the design of knowledge base. Further the representational enhancement of the knowledge has been done through construction of a hierarchical network, called RuleNet, using the concept of partially-ordered set (poset) with respect to the subset equality (subset of) relation. With implicit incorporation of probability within the knowledge, the RuleNet is used to derive reliable resolution logic along with effective resolution of uncertainties during clinical decision making. Results: The proposed methodology has been validated with clinical records of seventy seven LBP patients accessed from the database of ESI Hospital Sealdah, India over a period of one year from 2018 to 2019. Achieving 83% sensitivity of the proposed technique, the pain experts at the hospital find the design clinically satisfactory. The inferred outcomes have also been found to be homogeneous with the actual or original diagnosis. Discussions: The proposed approach achieves the clinical and computational efficiency by limiting the shortcomings of the existing methodologies for AI-based LBP diagnosis. While computational efficiency (with respect to both time and space complexity) is ensured by inferring clinical decisions through optimal processing of the knowledge items using poset, the clinical acceptability has been ascertained reaching to the most-likely diagnostic outcomes through probabilistic resolution of clinical uncertainties. Conclusion: The derived resolution technique, when embedded in LBP medical expert systems, would provide a fast, reliable, and affordable healthcare solution for this ailment to a wider range of general population suffering from LBP. The proposed scheme would significantly reduce the controversies and confusion in LBP treatment, and cut down the cost of unnecessary or inappropriate treatment and referral.","Medical expert system; Subgrouping of low back pain; Knowledge representation; Probabilistic inference logic; Partially ordered set; Clinical uncertainty handling","Santra, D (Corresponding Author), Univ Kalyani, Fac Engn Technol & Management, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Block C, Kalyani 741245, W Bengal, India.

Mainly, small businesses, healthcare, education, and government sectors have been under continuous attacks by these adversaries. Various static and dynamic analysis techniques exist, but these methods become less efficient as the malware writers continuously trick the defenders. Numerous research of ransomware with AI techniques often lack the behavioral analysis and its correlation mapping. In this work, we developed an AI-powered hybrid approach overcoming the recent challenges to detect ransomware. Specifically, we proposed a deep inspection approach for multi-level profiling of crypto-ransomware, which captures the distinct features at Dynamic link library, function call, and assembly levels. We showed how the code segments correlate at these levels for studied samples. Our hybrid multi-level analysis approach includes advanced static and dynamic methods and a novel strategy of analyzing behavioral chains with AI techniques. Moreover, association rule mining, natural language processing techniques, and machine learning classifiers are integrated for building ransomware validation and detection model. We experimented with crypto-ransomware samples (collected from VirusTotal). One of the machine learning algorithms achieved the highest accuracy of 99.72% and a false positive rate of 0.003 with two class datasets. The result exhibited that multi-level profiling can better detect ransomware samples with higher accuracy. The multi-level feature sequence can be extracted from most of the applications running in the different operating systems; therefore, we believe that our method can detect ransomware for devices on multiple platforms. We designed a prototype, AIRaD (AI-based Ransomware Detection) tool, which will allow researchers and the defenders to visualize the analysis with proper interpretation.","Ransomware; Malware; Cryptography; Tools; Phishing; Feature extraction; Encryption; Artificial intelligence; hybrid malware analysis; machine learning; multi-level profiling; ransomware detection; reverse engineering","Poudyal, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Memphis, Ctr Informat Assurance, Dept Comp Sci, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.

Security experts manually define different types of rules and scripts based on CTI to perform validation tasks. These rules and scripts need to be updated continuously due to evolving threats, changing SOCs' requirements and dynamic nature of CTI. The manual process of updating rules and scripts delays the response to attacks. To reduce the burden of human experts and accelerate response, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) based framework, SmartValidator. SmartValidator leverages Machine Learning (ML) techniques to enable automated validation of alerts. It consists of three layers to perform the tasks of data collection, model building and alert validation. It projects the validation task as a classification problem. Instead of building and saving models for all possible requirements, we propose to automatically construct the validation models based on SOC's requirements and CTI. We built a Proof of Concept (PoC) system with eight ML algorithms, two feature engineering techniques and 18 requirements to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of SmartValidator. The evaluation results showed that when prediction models were built automatically for classifying cyber threat data, the F1-score of 75% of the models were above 0.8, which indicates adequate performance of the PoC for use in a real-world organization. The results further showed that dynamic construction of prediction models required 99% less models to be built than pre-building models for all possible requirements. Thus, SmartValidator is much more efficient to use when SOCs' requirements and threat behaviour are constantly evolving. The framework can be followed by various industries to accelerate and automate the validation of alerts and incidents based on their CTI and SOC's preferences.","Security Operation Centre; Cyber Threat Information; Threat intelligence; Alert validator; Cyber security; Threat data; Security automation; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Natural language processing","Islam, C (Corresponding Author), Univ Adelaide, CREST Ctr Res Engn Software Technol, Adelaide, SA, Australia.

Several research efforts are being made to exploit sensorized smart-homes and artificial intelligence (AI) methods to detect a decline of the cognitive functions of the elderly in order to promptly alert practitioners. Even though those tools may provide accurate predictions, they currently provide limited support to clinicians in making a diagnosis. Indeed, most AI systems do not provide any explanation of the reason why a given prediction was computed. Other systems are based on a set of rules that are easy to interpret by a human. However, those rule-based systems can cope with a limited number of abnormal situations, and are not flexible enough to adapt to different users and contextual situations. In this paper, we tackle this challenging problem by proposing a flexible AI system to recognize early symptoms of cognitive decline in smart-homes, which is able to explain the reason of predictions at a fine-grained level. Our method relies on well known clinical indicators that consider subtle and overt behavioral anomalies, as well as spatial disorientation and wandering behaviors. In order to adapt to different individuals and situations, anomalies are recognized using a collaborative approach. We experimented our approach with a large set of real world subjects, including people with MCI and people with dementia. We also implemented a dashboard to allow clinicians to inspect anomalies together with the explanations of predictions. Results show that our system's predictions are significantly correlated to the person's actual diagnosis. Moreover, a preliminary user study with clinicians suggests that the explanation capabilities of our system are useful to improve the task performance and to increase trust. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores data-driven explainable AI for supporting the diagnosis of cognitive decline. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, the use of these applications in sensitive clinical domains where high-stakes decisions are involved could be much more extensive if patients, medical professionals, and regulators were provided with mechanisms for trusting the results provided by AI systems. A key issue for achieving this is endowing AI systems with key dimensions of Trustworthy AI (TAI), such as fairness, transparency, robustness, or accountability, which are not usually considered within this context in a generalized and systematic manner. This paper reviews the recent advances in the TAI domain, including TAI standards and guidelines. We propose several requirements to be addressed in the design, development, and deployment of TAI systems and present a novel machine learning pipeline that contains TAI requirements as embedded components. Moreover, as an example of how current AI systems in medicine consider the TAI perspective, the study extensively reviews the recent literature (2017-2021) on AI systems in a prevalent and high social-impact disease: diagnosis and progression detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The most relevant AI systems in the AD domain are compared and discussed (such as machine learning, deep learning, ensembles, time series, and multimodal multitask) from the perspective of how they address TAI in their design. Several open challenges are highlighted, which could be claimed as one of the main reasons to justify the rare application of AI systems in real clinical environments. The study provides a roadmap to measure the TAI status of an AI systems and highlights its limitations. In addition, it provides the main guidelines to overcome these limitations and build medically trusted AI-based applications in the medical domain.","Trustworthy AI; AI for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and progression detection; Machine learning in medicine; Responsible AI; Fairness; accountability; and transparency in AI","Abuhmed, T (Corresponding Author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Suwon, South Korea.

An increasing number of AI-based applications have been developed, among which conversational AI has emerged. Regarding the latter, ChatGPT has risen to the headlines, scientific and otherwise, for its distinct propensity to simulate a `real' discussion with its interlocutor, based on appropriate prompts. Although several clinical studies using ChatGPT have already been published in the literature, very little has yet been written about its potential application in human pathology. We conduct a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, using PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science (WoS) as databases, with the following keywords: ChatGPT OR Chat GPT, in combination with each of the following: pathology, diagnostic pathology, anatomic pathology, before 31 July 2023. A total of 103 records were initially identified in the literature search, of which 19 were duplicates. After screening for eligibility and inclusion criteria, only five publications were ultimately included. The majority of publications were original articles (n = 2), followed by a case report (n = 1), letter to the editor (n = 1) and review (n = 1). Furthermore, we performed a `query session' with ChatGPT regarding pathologies such as pigmented skin lesions, malignant melanoma and variants, Gleason's score of prostate adenocarcinoma, differential diagnosis between germ cell tumors and high grade serous carcinoma of the ovary, pleural mesothelioma and pediatric diffuse midline glioma. Although the premises are exciting and ChatGPT is able to co-advise the pathologist in providing large amounts of scientific data for use in routine microscopic diagnostic practice, there are many limitations (such as data of training, amount of data available, `hallucination' phenomena) that need to be addressed and resolved, with the caveat that an AI-driven system should always provide support and never a decision-making motive during the histopathological diagnostic process.","ChatGPT; chatbot; artificial intelligence; AI; pathology; histology","Cazzato, G (Corresponding Author), Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Precis & Regenerat Med & Ionian Area DiMePRe, Sect Mol Pathol, I-70124 Bari, Italy.

Additionally, utilising advanced sensing technologies based on flexible and innovative biocompatible materials in wearable devices allows high accuracy and precision measurement of biological signals. Furthermore, applying real-time Machine Learning algorithms to highly accurate physiological parameters allows precise identification of unusual patterns in the data to provide health event predictions and warnings for timely intervention. However, in the predominantly adopted architectures, health event predictions based on Machine Learning are typically obtained by leveraging Cloud infrastructures characterised by shortcomings such as delayed response times and privacy issues. Fortunately, recent works highlight that a new paradigm based on Edge Computing technologies and on-device Artificial Intelligence significantly improve the latency and privacy issues. Applying this new paradigm to personalised healthcare architectures can significantly improve their efficiency and efficacy. Therefore, this paper reviews existing IoT healthcare architectures that utilise wearable devices and subsequently presents a scalable and modular system architecture to leverage emerging technologies to solve identified shortcomings. The defined architecture includes ultrathin, skin-compatible, flexible, high precision piezoelectric sensors, low-cost communication technologies, on-device intelligence, Edge Intelligence, and Edge Computing technologies. To provide development guidelines and define a consistent reference architecture for improved scalable wearable IoT-based critical healthcare architectures, this manuscript outlines the essential functional and non-functional requirements based on deductions from existing architectures and emerging technology trends. The presented system architecture can be applied to many scenarios, including ambient assisted living, where continuous surveillance and issuance of timely warnings can afford independence to the elderly and chronically ill. We conclude that the distribution and modularity of architecture layers, local AI-based elaboration, and data packaging consistency are the more essential functional requirements for critical healthcare application use cases. We also identify fast response time, utility, comfort, and low cost as the essential non-functional requirements for the defined system architecture.","internet of things; edge intelligence; healthcare and wellness; piezoelectric sensors; multi-sensor; anomaly detection","Patrono, L (Corresponding Author), Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.

We argue that such an approach to solution development makes the outcome of solutions less explainable, i.e., it is often not possible to explain the results of the model. There is a growing concern among policymakers in cities with this lack of explainability of AI solutions, and this is considered a major hindrance in the wider acceptability and trust in such AI-based solutions. In this work, we survey the concept of `explainable deep learning' as a subset of the `explainable AI' problem and propose a new solution using Semantic Web technologies, demonstrated with a smart cities flood monitoring application in the context of a European Commission-funded project. Monitoring of gullies and drainage in crucial geographical areas susceptible to flooding issues is an important aspect of any flood monitoring solution. Typical solutions for this problem involve the use of cameras to capture images showing the affected areas in real-time with different objects such as leaves, plastic bottles etc., and building a DL-based classifier to detect such objects and classify blockages based on the presence and coverage of these objects in the images. In this work, we uniquely propose an Explainable AI solution using DL and Semantic Web technologies to build a hybrid classifier. In this hybrid classifier, the DL component detects object presence and coverage level and semantic rules designed with close consultation with experts carry out the classification. By using the expert knowledge in the flooding context, our hybrid classifier provides the flexibility on categorising the image using objects and their coverage relationships. The experimental results demonstrated with a real-world use case showed that this hybrid approach of image classification has on average 11% improvement (F-Measure) in image classification performance compared to DL-only classifier. It also has the distinct advantage of integrating experts' knowledge on defining the decision-making rules to represent the complex circumstances and using such knowledge to explain the results.","explainable AI; multi-object; coverage detection; semantic Rules; hybrid image classification; flood monitoring","Thakker, D (Corresponding Author), Univ Bradford, Dept Comp Sci, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England.

Stroke diseases can be divided into ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke, and they should be minimized by emergency treatment such as thrombolytic or coagulant administration by type. First, it is essential to detect in real time the precursor symptoms of stroke, which occur differently for each individual, and to provide professional treatment by a medical institution within the proper treatment window. However, prior studies have focused on developing acute treatment or clinical treatment guidelines after the onset of stroke rather than detecting the prognostic symptoms of stroke. In particular, in recent studies, image analysis such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) has mostly been used to detect and predict prognostic symptoms in stroke patients. Not only are these methodologies difficult to diagnose early in real-time, but they also have limitations in terms of a long test time and a high cost of testing. In this paper, we propose a system that can predict and semantically interpret stroke prognostic symptoms based on machine learning using the multi-modal bio-signals of electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) measured in real-time for the elderly. To predict stroke disease in real-time while walking, we designed and implemented a stroke disease prediction system with an ensemble structure that combines CNN and LSTM. The proposed system considers the convenience of wearing the bio-signal sensors for the elderly, and the bio-signals were collected at a sampling rate of 1,000Hz per second from the three electrodes of the ECG and the index finger for PPG while walking. According to the experimental results, C4.5 decision tree showed a prediction accuracy of 91.56% while RandomForest showed a prediction accuracy of 97.51% during walking by the elderly. In addition, the CNN-LSTM model using raw data of ECG and PPG showed satisfactory prediction accuracy of 99.15%. As a result, the real-time prediction of the elderly stroke patients simultaneously showed high prediction accuracy and performance.","Diseases; Electrocardiography; Stroke (medical condition); Real-time systems; Older adults; Heart; Aging; Deep learning; machine learning; electrocardiogram (ECG); photo plethysmography (PPG); multi-modal bio-signal; real-time stroke prediction; stroke disease analysis","Lee, H (Corresponding Author), Andong Natl Univ, Sch Creat Convergence, Andong 36729, Gyeongsangbuk D, South Korea.

Although commonly used eXplainable AI (XAI) methods provide insights into these largely opaque algorithms, such explanations are usually convoluted and not readily comprehensible. The explanation of decisions regarding the malignancy of skin lesions from dermoscopic images demands particular clarity, as the underlying medical problem definition is ambiguous in itself. This work presents ExAID (Explainable AI for Dermatology), a novel XAI framework for biomedical image analysis that provides multi-modal concept-based explanations, consisting of easy-to-understand textual explanations and visual maps, to justify the predictions. Methods: Our framework relies on Concept Activation Vectors to map human-understandable concepts to those learned by an arbitrary Deep Learning (DL) based algorithm, and Concept Localisation Maps to highlight those concepts in the input space. This identification of relevant concepts is then used to construct fine-grained textual explanations supplemented by concept-wise location information to provide comprehensive and coherent multi-modal explanations. All decision-related information is presented in a diagnostic interface for use in clinical routines. Moreover, the framework includes an educational mode providing dataset-level explanation statistics as well as tools for data and model exploration to aid medical research and education processes. Results: Through rigorous quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our framework on a range of publicly available dermoscopic image datasets, we show the utility of multi-modal explanations for CAD-assisted scenarios even in case of wrong disease predictions. We demonstrate that concept detectors for the explanation of pre-trained networks reach accuracies of up to 81.46%, which is comparable to supervised networks trained end-to-end. Conclusions: We present a new end-to-end framework for the multi-modal explanation of DL-based biomedical image analysis in Melanoma classification and evaluate its utility on an array of datasets. Since perspicuous explanation is one of the cornerstones of any CAD system, we believe that ExAID will accelerate the transition from AI research to practice by providing dermatologists and researchers with an effective tool that they can both understand and trust. ExAID can also serve as the basis for similar applications in other biomedical fields. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

This paper (The work of the second author was partially supported by NSERC, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada. We are very grateful for the feedback from the anonymous Referees of the original submission. Their input significantly improved the quality of this final version.) presents some novel schemes for the last of the three areas. There have been thousands of papers written regarding the algorithms themselves, and the hardware vendors are scrambling for the market share. However, the question of how to store, manage and access data, which has been central to the field of Computer Science, is even more pertinent in these days when megabytes of data are being generated every second. This paper considers the problem of minimizing the cost of retrieval using the most fundamental data structure, i.e., a Singly-Linked List (SLL). We consider a SLL in which the elements are accessed by a Non-stationary Environment (NSE) exhibiting the so-called ``Locality of Reference''. We propose a solution to the problem by designing an ``Adaptive'' Data Structure (ADS), which is created by utilizing a composite of hierarchical data ``sub''-structures to constitute the overall data structure (In this paper, the primitive data structure is the SLL. However, these concepts can be extended to more complicated data structures.). In this paper, we design hierarchical Lists-on-Lists (LOLs) by assembling a SLL into a hierarchical scheme that results in SLLs on SLLs (SLLs-on-SLLs) comprising of an outer-list and sublist contexts. The goal is that elements that are more likely to be accessed together are grouped within the same sub-context, while the sublists themselves are moved ``en masse'' towards the head of the list-context to minimize the overall access cost. This move is carried out by employing the ``de-facto'' list re-organization schemes, i.e., the Move-To-Front (MTF) and Transposition (TR) rules. To achieve the clustering of elements within the sublists, we invoke the Object Migration Automaton (OMA) family of reinforcement schemes from the theory of Learning Automata (LA). They capture the probabilistic dependence of the elements in the data structure, receiving query accesses from the Environment. We show that SLLs-on-SLLs augmented with the Enhanced OMA (EOMA) minimizes the retrieval cost for elements in NSEs, and are superior to the stand-alone MTF and TR schemes, and also superior to the OMA-augmented SLLs-on-SLLs operating in such Environments.","Learning automata; ``Adaptive'' data structures; Hierarchical singly-linked lists; Object migration automaton","Oommen, BJ (Corresponding Author), Carleton Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.
